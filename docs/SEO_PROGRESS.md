Old GitHub PAT was removed from `.git/config`. ~~User still needs to revoke it.~~ **RESOLVED 2026-08-21 (session 3):** the user checked github.com/settings/tokens and there are no personal access tokens on the account at all. Fine-grained PATs carry a mandatory expiry, so it had almost certainly lapsed on its own. Verified independently: no token in `.git/config`, zero token matches across full git history, and `gh` authenticates with a `gho_` OAuth token in the Windows keyring (which lives under Settings > Applications, not under Personal access tokens). Nothing further to do — do not re-raise this item.

## Baseline metrics (90 days, pulled 2026-08-21)

**244 clicks / 3,250 impressions / 14 pages**

| Page | Clicks | Impr | CTR | Pos |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | 181 | 547 | 33.1% | 5.5 |
| `/drills` | 26 | 705 | 3.69% | 8.8 |
| `/drills/fps` | 8 | 622 | 1.29% | 32.5 |
| `/drills/visual` | 8 | 161 | 4.97% | 11.2 |
| `/drills/academic` | 6 | 185 | 3.24% | 9.7 |
| `/drills/fps/flick-shot-training` | 6 | 327 | 1.83% | 12.7 |
| `/drills/cognitive` | 3 | 182 | 1.65% | 7.6 |
| `/drills/motor` | 2 | 145 | 1.38% | 6.8 |
| `/drills/physical` | 2 | 156 | 1.28% | 18.3 |
| `/drills/productivity` | 2 | 39 | 5.13% | 17.2 |
| `/drills/memory` | 0 | 163 | 0% | 23.3 |
| `/drills/mental-fitness` | 0 | 8 | 0% | 6.5 |
| `/drills/visual-tracking` | 0 | 9 | 0% | 1.2 |

Competitive query positions (all essentially unranked):
`aim trainer online` 65.8 · `aim training online` 61.8 · `aim trainer free` 71.3 · `skill drills` 29.4

Note: query-dimension totals (56 clicks) are lower than page totals (244) because Google withholds low-volume queries. Trust page numbers.

## ROOT CAUSE (verified with live fetches, not guessed)

Two bugs compound into one fatal problem: **Google sees a loading skeleton on every category hub page.**

### Bug 1 — SSR is disabled by a client-only gate
`if (!isClient) { return <DrillLoading />; }` — e.g. [app/drills/fps/FPSHubClient.js:169](app/drills/fps/FPSHubClient.js#L169)

`isClient` is false during server rendering, so the server emits a loading spinner instead of content.

Affects 8 hub files:
- `app/drills/fps/FPSHubClient.js`
- `app/drills/cognitive/CognitiveHubClient.js`
- `app/drills/memory/MemoryClient.js`
- `app/drills/motor/MotorDrillsClient.js`
- `app/drills/physical/PhysicalDrillsClient.js`
- `app/drills/visual/VisualDrillsClient.js`
- `app/drills/reaction-speed/ReactionSpeedDrillsClient.tsx`
- `app/drills/visual-tracking/VisualTrackingDrillsClient.tsx`

### Bug 2 — the JS that would fix it is blocked
[app/robots.js](../app/robots.js) disallows `/_next/` for Googlebot and every other crawler. Google cannot load the JS bundle, so it can never render past the skeleton.

### Proof (live fetch as Googlebot, 2026-08-21)
| URL | Visible words in HTML | H1 |
|---|---|---|
| `/drills/fps` | **74** | **none** |
| `/drills/fps/flick-shot-training` | 234 | present |
| `/` | 629 (includes "Loading…") | present |

`/drills/fps` has 622 impressions and sits at position 32.5 — because Google literally sees 74 words and no heading.

### Bug 3 — every AI search crawler is blocked
[app/robots.js](../app/robots.js) has `disallow: '/'` for: `OAI-SearchBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, `PerplexityBot`, `ClaudeBot`, `Claude-Web`, `anthropic-ai`, `Google-Extended`, `GPTBot`, `CCBot`, `YouBot`, `cohere-ai`, `Meta-ExternalAgent`, `GoogleOther`.

This directly defeats the stated goal of "AI should suggest my website." Critically:
- `OAI-SearchBot` = ChatGPT Search index (not training)
- `PerplexityBot` = Perplexity
- `Google-Extended` = AI Overviews / Gemini grounding
These are *search* crawlers, not training scrapers. Blocking them removes the site from AI answers entirely.

---

## Verdict on ChatGPT's suggestions

| Claim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Remove `/_next/` from robots | **Correct and critical** |
| Unblock OAI-SearchBot / PerplexityBot | **Correct**, and understated — 13 AI bots blocked |
| Server-render main content | **Correct**, but root cause is the `isClient` gate, not "use client" itself |
| Submit sitemap / request indexing | Correct, standard |
| Focus on FPS positioning | Reasonable strategy, debatable priority |
| Add analytics events | Fine, low priority vs. the crawl bug |
| Translations + hreflang | Premature — do after indexing is fixed |
| "Verify as domain property" | Optional; URL-prefix property already works |

ChatGPT was directionally right on the top items but had no data. The `isClient` gate — the actual root cause — was not identified.

## PLAN

### Phase 1 — Unblock crawling  ✅ DONE (code; not yet deployed)
- [x] 1.1 Removed `/_next/` from all disallow lists in `app/robots.js`
- [x] 1.2 Removed `/styles/` and `/lib/` disallows
- [x] 1.3 Unblocked AI search crawlers (17 allowed incl. OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, Claude-SearchBot)
- [x] 1.4 Removed `curl`/`python-requests`/`wget` blocks
- Backup of the original at `app/robots.js.bak`
- Validated: 73 rules, Googlebot disallow is now only `['/api/','/.vercel/']`, `_next` appears nowhere

### Phase 2 — Fix SSR  ✅ DONE (code; not yet deployed)
- [x] 2.1 Removed `if (!isClient) return <DrillLoading />` from all 8 hub clients
      - Safe because `drillLevels` initialises to `{}` on both server and client, so the
        first client render matches the server HTML; localStorage is only read inside
        `useEffect`, which runs after hydration. The gate was never needed.
- [x] 2.2 Removed the 8 now-orphaned `DrillLoading` imports. `app/loading.js` and
      `app/drills/loading.js` still use it correctly as Suspense fallbacks — left alone.
- [x] 2.3 Removed duplicate `<noscript><h1>` blocks from `app/page.js` and
      `app/drills/motor/page.js` (they were a workaround for the broken SSR and were
      creating two H1s per page). Every page now has exactly one H1.
- [x] 2.4 Verified against the prerendered HTML in `.next/server/app/`

**Result — server-rendered words per page, before -> after:**

| Page | Before | After | H1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/drills/fps` | 74 | **710** | added |
| `/drills/cognitive` | (skeleton) | 459 | ok |
| `/drills/memory` | (skeleton) | 419 | ok |
| `/drills/motor` | (skeleton) | 471 | ok |
| `/drills/physical` | (skeleton) | 551 | ok |
| `/drills/visual` | (skeleton) | 591 | ok |
| `/drills/reaction-speed` | (skeleton) | 376 | ok |
| `/drills/visual-tracking` | (skeleton) | 502 | ok |
| `/drills` | - | 439 | ok |
| `/` | 629 | 604 | 1 (was 2) |

Build: `npx next build` -> compiled successfully, no errors.

### Phase 3 — Server-rendered content depth
- [ ] 3.1 Move hero H1 + intro prose into the server `page.js` for each hub
- [ ] 3.2 Add unique 300–600 word server-rendered body to each of the top drill pages
- [ ] 3.3 Add FAQ blocks (server-rendered, matching existing FAQPage schema)

### Phase 4 — Re-index
- [ ] 4.1 Deploy, verify live robots.txt
- [ ] 4.2 Resubmit sitemap in GSC
- [ ] 4.3 URL-inspect + request indexing for `/drills/fps`, `/drills/memory`, `/drills`, top 10 drills
- [ ] 4.4 Bing Webmaster Tools

### Phase 5 — Growth
- [ ] 5.1 Titles/descriptions for `/drills/motor` + `/drills/cognitive` (only real CTR gaps)
- [ ] 5.2 Internal linking between related drills
- [ ] 5.3 Distribution (communities, video, shareable score cards)
- [ ] 5.4 Translations — only after country data justifies it

## STATUS LOG

**2026-08-21**
- Connected GitHub, Vercel, Search Console
- Built `scripts/gsc/gsc.py`; fixed two of my own bugs in it (escaped-newline breakage, and an invented CTR decay curve replaced with real position-CTR data)
- Pulled 90-day baseline (above)
- Diagnosed root cause with live Googlebot fetches
- Phase 1 complete: `app/robots.js` rewritten (180+ rules -> 73, `/_next/` unblocked, AI bots allowed)
- Phase 2 complete: SSR restored on all 8 hubs, orphaned imports and duplicate H1s cleaned
- Phase 3 complete: 8 hub H1s rewritten, 50 page titles shortened below the truncation limit
- Final build: `npx next build` -> compiled successfully. All 10 key pages verified:
  exactly 1 H1 each, 377-708 server-rendered words each, no loading skeleton.
- **User is handling deploy themselves after testing. Nothing committed or pushed.**
- **NEXT AFTER DEPLOY: Phase 4 re-indexing in GSC**

### Phase 3 — On-page signals  ✅ DONE (code; not yet deployed)
- [x] 3.1 Rewrote all 8 hub H1s to lead with the actual search term:

| Page | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `/drills/fps` | FPS Aim & Reflex | **Free FPS Aim Trainer** |
| `/drills/cognitive` | Decision & Priority Speed | Brain Training & Decision Speed |
| `/drills/memory` | Memory Span & Sequence Recall | Memory Training & Recall |
| `/drills/motor` | Motor Sector | Mouse Precision & Motor Drills |
| `/drills/physical` | Physical Sector | Reflex & Coordination Training |
| `/drills/visual` | Visual Training System | Visual Training & Recognition |
| `/drills/reaction-speed` | Reaction Speed Drills | Reaction Time Test & Drills |
| `/drills/visual-tracking` | Visual Tracking Systems | Visual Tracking Training |

  **Homepage H1 deliberately left as "Master Your Mind & Mechanics"** — it is at
  position 5.5 with 33% CTR and 181 of the site's 244 clicks. It works. Changing
  it risks brand for no measurable gain.

- [x] 3.2 Title-length pass. 37 of 68 titles were over 60 chars and truncating
      in search results. Hub titles rewritten by hand; 43 drill titles had the
      ` | SkillDrills` suffix dropped (keywords matter more than a trailing brand
      Google often appends anyway).
      Longest title now **69 chars, was 88**. Median 57.

  Notable: `/drills/motor` (77 -> 55) and `/drills/cognitive` (87 -> 53) were the
  two pages measured as genuine CTR underperformers. Truncated titles are a
  plausible cause — worth re-checking in GSC after 3-4 weeks.

- [ ] 3.3 Unique 300-600 word server-rendered body per top drill page (not started)
- [ ] 3.4 Server-rendered FAQ blocks matching existing FAQPage schema (not started)

### Superseded — weak H1 text (resolved in Phase 3.1)
SSR now works, but the visible H1s are brand copy with no search value:
- `/` -> "Master Your Mind & Mechanics"
- `/drills/motor` -> "Motor Sector"
- `/drills/fps` -> "FPS Aim & Reflex"

The keyword-rich strings that used to sit in the deleted `<noscript>` blocks
(e.g. "Free Aim Trainer & Motor Skills Drills - Mouse Precision, Click Speed &
Hand Eye Coordination") are better SEO copy. Rewriting the visible H1s is a
design/branding decision — **needs the user's call before changing.**

### Uncommitted files as of this entry (~64 files)
`app/robots.js`, `.gitignore`, the 8 hub clients, 50 `page.js`/`page.tsx` metadata
edits, `app/page.js`, `app/drills/motor/page.js`.
New: `SEO_PROGRESS.md`, `scripts/gsc/`, `app/robots.js.bak`.

**Nothing committed, pushed, or deployed.** User deploys after their own testing.

### Smoke test to run after deploying
1. Load 2-3 hub pages, check browser console for React hydration warnings.
   Removing the `isClient` gate is the change most likely to surface one.
   Reasoning says it's safe (`drillLevels` starts `{}` on both sides, localStorage
   only read in `useEffect`) but this has not been runtime-tested.
2. `curl -s https://skilldrills.online/robots.txt | grep _next` -> must return nothing.
3. Fetch `/drills/fps` as Googlebot -> expect ~700 words, H1 "Free FPS Aim Trainer".
4. Rollback if needed: `app/robots.js.bak`, or `git revert`.

> Use `npx next build` for compile checks. `npm run build` fires a live IndexNow
> ping to Bing/Yandex/Seznam via postbuild — only run it when you actually intend that.

# SESSION 2 — 2026-08-21 (later)

## The single most important fact

**Session 1's work was never deployed.** Live `robots.txt` still contained
`Disallow: /_next/` and the live hubs still served a loading skeleton when this
session started. Everything below is *also* undeployed. Nothing ships until the
user deploys.

Measured live as Googlebot at the start of this session:

| URL | Live words | H1 |
|---|---|---|
| `/drills/fps` | 61 | none |
| `/drills/memory` | 61 | none |
| `/drills/fps/flick-shot-training` | 220 | 1 |
| `/drills/visual-tracking/triangular-pursuit` | 237 | 1 |

## Hard indexing data (GSC URL Inspection API, all 91 sitemap URLs)

| Coverage state | Count |
|---|---|
| Submitted and indexed | **9** |
| Discovered - currently not indexed | **76** |
| URL is unknown to Google | **6** |

**82 of 91 URLs have never been crawled by Google. Not once.**

Referring-URL breakdown for those 82:

| Source | Count |
|---|---|
| No referrer at all | 64 |
| Only `sitemap.xml` | 20 |
| A real internal link | 7 |

That is the answer to "why are ~80 pages not indexed": the hub pages rendered as
skeletons, so **Google never saw a single link to any drill page**. The drills
were orphans, discoverable only via the sitemap, and Google declines to spend
crawl budget on sitemap-only URLs from a low-authority site.

Puller script: `scratchpad/gsc_index.py`. Do NOT name it `inspect.py` — that
shadows the stdlib `inspect` module and breaks the google-auth import chain.

## Root causes found and fixed this session

### 1. All 81 drill pages were thin — content was never in the HTML

`components/drill/DrillAccordion.js` rendered `{isOpen && <div>{children}</div>}`.
`openAccordion` initialises to `null`, so on the server *and* on first client
render **every accordion body was absent from the DOM**: drill instructions, the
whole About section, and every FAQ answer. Drill pages carried ~160 rendered
words while their `FAQPage` JSON-LD advertised up to 14 Q&As that appeared
nowhere on the page — a schema/content mismatch as well as a thin-content problem.

Fixed by always rendering children and collapsing with the `hidden` attribute
(the correct ARIA pattern for an `aria-controls` region; Tailwind preflight
supplies the `[hidden] { display: none }` rule). The open animation is preserved
by applying `fx-fade-up` only while open, so re-adding the class restarts it.

**Median drill page: 163 -> 686 rendered words from this one change.**

### 2. One drill still had the Session-1 `isClient` bug

`app/drills/visual/tracking-accuracy/multiple-targets/GhostLinkClient.js:649`
had a `loading || !isClient` early return to a spinner. Session 1 fixed the 8
hubs but never scanned the drill clients. This page rendered **46 words**. The
gate and its now-dead `loading`/`isClient` state were removed; it now renders
533 words. A repo-wide scan confirms no other file has this pattern.

### 3. Four dead URLs were still earning impressions

Deleted sections still ranking and returning 404:

| URL | Clicks | Impr | Pos |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/drills/academic` | 6 | 185 | 9.7 |
| `/drills/productivity` | 2 | 39 | 17.2 |
| `/drills/academic/comprehension/inference-drill` | 0 | 11 | 10.9 |
| `/drills/mental-fitness` | 0 | 8 | 6.5 |

243 impressions — 7.5% of all site impressions — landing on 404s. 301s added in
`next.config.js` to the nearest live equivalent, with the old
`/drills/academic/reading-speed/rsvp-reader` pointed at the surviving
`/drills/cognitive/processing-speed/rsvp-reader`.

### 4. The 15 visual-tracking pages were near-duplicates

All 15 shared the identical title suffix "Visual Tracking & Gaze Calibration
Drill" and measured **0.77 mean pairwise text similarity** (peaks of 0.93). Every
one was unindexed. No other category exceeds 0.45.

- All 15 titles rewritten to target a distinct real search term. Drill names like
  "Triangular Pursuit" have no search volume, so each title now pairs the name
  with a term people actually search. Longest is now 53 chars.
- New `app/drills/visual-tracking/guides.js` plus
  `components/drill/DrillGuide.js`: a server-rendered long-form block with
  per-drill prose, training steps, audience and extra FAQs. The extra FAQs are
  concatenated into each page's existing `FAQPage` schema so the structured data
  matches the visible page.

**visual-tracking similarity: 0.77 -> 0.48.** Median drill words: 686 -> 786.

### 5. Metadata hygiene

- 32 titles were over 60 chars, so they truncated in SERPs. **Now 0.**
- 28 meta descriptions were over 160 chars. **Now 0.**
- 0 duplicate titles across the whole site.
- `/search` was `index, follow` while rendering 23 words with no H1 — an
  indexable near-empty page. Now `noindex, follow`.
- The 404 description still advertised "typing tests, and mental fitness tools",
  both deleted from the site. Rewritten.

**Watch out:** a naive regex over the `description:` field breaks on descriptions
containing an escaped apostrophe (`peeker\'s`, `\'slicing the pie\'`). It
silently truncates at the escaped quote and corrupts the file. Two files in
`app/drills/reaction-speed/` contain these. One was corrupted and repaired.

## Verification (local production build plus `next start`)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx next build` | compiled successfully, 180 static pages |
| Drill pages: rendered words | min 367 / median 786 / mean 752 / max 1235 |
| Pages with exactly one H1 | all checked pages |
| Titles over 60 chars | 0 |
| Descriptions over 160 chars | 0 |
| Duplicate titles | 0 |
| Orphan drill routes | 0 (was 64 with no referrer at all) |
| Built `robots.txt` | 73 rules, no `_next` block, AI search bots allowed |
| Redirect smoke test | `/drills/academic`, `/drills/productivity` return 308 |
| FAQ schema vs page | 7 questions in schema, all 7 visible in HTML |

Before and after on the pages that matter:

| URL | Live now | After deploy |
|---|---|---|
| `/drills/fps` | 61 | 698 |
| `/drills/memory` | 61 | 410 |
| `/drills/fps/flick-shot-training` | 220 | 1240 |
| `/drills/visual-tracking/triangular-pursuit` | 237 | 817 |
| `/drills/visual/tracking-accuracy/multiple-targets` | spinner | 533 |

## Honest read on the 100k/month goal

Current: ~3,250 impressions and 244 clicks per **90 days**, which is roughly
**80 clicks/month**. 100,000 visitors/month is about a 1,250x increase.

Query data says why. Of 56 clicks on the query dimension, **~48 are brand**
("skilldrills", "skill drills", "drill your skill"). Every non-brand commercial
term sits at position 45-78, which is page 5 to 8 — invisible:

`aim trainer online` 65.8 · `aim training online` 61.8 · `aim trainer free` 71.3

Those head terms are held by Aimlabs, Kovaak's, aimtrainer.io and
3daimtrainer.com. On-page work does not move a site from position 65 to page 1
on terms like that; domain authority does, and that means links and distribution.

What the fixes above realistically unlock: 82 pages going from *never crawled* to
indexed, each targeting long-tail terms with little competition. That is the
difference between ~900 impressions/month and something in the low tens of
thousands, over 2-3 months. **100k/month is a 12-24 month goal that needs
off-site work, not another on-page pass.**

## NEXT — in order

1. **Deploy.** Nothing above is live. Everything else is blocked on this.
2. Verify live: `curl -s https://skilldrills.online/robots.txt | grep _next`
   must return nothing, and `/drills/fps` must serve ~700 words and an H1.
3. Browser-check 2-3 hub pages and one visual-tracking page for React hydration
   warnings. Reasoning says the accordion change is safe — `openAccordion` is
   `null` on both sides, so `hidden` matches — and the static build proves no
   browser API is touched during render, but it has not been runtime-tested in a
   real browser.
4. GSC: resubmit the sitemap, then URL-inspect and Request Indexing for
   `/drills/fps`, `/drills/memory`, `/drills`, and the top 10 drill pages.
   Re-run `scratchpad/gsc_index.py` after ~3 weeks to watch
   "Discovered - currently not indexed" drain.
5. Bing Webmaster Tools — the site is not registered there.
6. **Consider rebuilding the academic section.** It was deleted but still ranks
   at position 9.7 with 185 impressions. "typing test", "speed reading" and
   "mental math" are far higher-volume and far less contested than "aim trainer".
   Right now those impressions are being redirected away.
7. Off-site work: this is the actual constraint. Communities, video, shareable
   score cards, links.

### Open question for the user

`AhrefsBot` and `SemrushBot` are among the 32 fully-blocked user agents. That
also blocks the user from auditing their own site with those tools and hides
their own backlink profile from them. Unblock or keep? `PetalBot` (Huawei
search) and `Bytespider` (ByteDance search) are also blocked; both are minor.

# SESSION 3 — 2026-08-21 (security review + sitemap + keyword SEO)

Session 2's work **was** committed this time (`9be849b`). This session's changes
sit on top of it and are again uncommitted and undeployed.

## Security review

Scope: dependencies, the one API route, response headers, secret exposure (working
tree and full git history), and the reflected-input surface.

### Fixed

| # | Issue | Severity | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `POST /api/indexnow` was effectively unauthenticated | **High** | Split the two keys apart |
| 2 | 4 Next.js CVEs, 2 PostCSS, nanoid, js-yaml, brace-expansion | **High** | `npm audit fix` |
| 3 | 4 libvips CVEs via sharp 0.34.5 | High (not reachable here) | Forced `sharp@^0.35.3` via `overrides` |
| 4 | CSP had no `frame-ancestors`, `base-uri`, `form-action` or `object-src` | Medium | Added |
| 5 | `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` | Low | Set to `0` |
| 6 | No `security.txt` at the RFC 9116 path | Low | Added `/.well-known/security.txt` |
| 7 | API responses were cacheable and indexable | Low | `no-store` + `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` |

**#1 in detail.** `app/api/indexnow/route.js` authorised POST by comparing the
caller's key against `INDEXNOW_KEY` — a value the IndexNow protocol *requires* to
be published at `/indexnow-key.txt`, and which the same route's own GET handler
returned to anyone who asked. So anyone could read the key and then drive the
endpoint, which fires POSTs to Bing, Yandex, Seznam and Naver under our host
identity, 100 URLs at a time, unthrottled. That is an abuse amplifier and a good
way to get the site's IndexNow key rate-limited or the host flagged.

Now:
- `INDEXNOW_KEY` stays the public protocol key. It never gates a write.
- `INDEXNOW_ADMIN_KEY` is a new env-only secret with no fallback. Unset means the
  route refuses every POST with 503 rather than failing open.
- Constant-time key comparison, `Authorization: Bearer` accepted, 5 submissions
  per hour per instance, `new URL(u, BASE)` origin validation, and the URL list is
  no longer echoed into the logs.

**Set `INDEXNOW_ADMIN_KEY` in the Vercel project env vars** or the route stays
off. Nothing in the app calls it — `scripts/notify-indexnow.js` (postbuild) talks
to the engines directly — so leaving it unset breaks nothing.

Verified against a local `next start`:

```
POST with the public key   -> 401 Unauthorized        (no relay fired)
POST off-origin URL        -> 400 Invalid URL origin  (no relay fired)
POST 101 URLs              -> 400 Too many URLs
POST with ADMIN key unset  -> 503 Endpoint disabled
GET                        -> still serves the public key (the protocol needs it)
```

`npm audit`: **6 high → 0**.

### Checked and clean

- No secrets in the working tree or in any commit across full git history. The
  only credential-shaped string is the IndexNow key, which is public by protocol.
- `.env` holds one non-secret (`GEMINI_MODEL`) and is gitignored; never committed.
- `.git/config` carries no token.
- All 358 `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` uses are JSON-LD built from static author
  copy. No user input reaches any of them.
- `/search` reflects `?q=` as a JSX text node, so React escapes it. No XSS.
- GSC credentials live outside the repo and are gitignored.

### Not fixed, deliberately

- `script-src` keeps `'unsafe-inline'`. Next.js emits inline bootstrap and flight
  scripts on every page; removing it needs nonce plumbing through the whole app.
  Worth doing, but it is a project, not a patch.
- sharp's libvips CVEs need attacker-supplied images. The only image path is
  `next/image` with `remotePatterns` limited to our own host, and the site has no
  upload anywhere. Patched anyway, since it turned out to be free.
- ~~The old GitHub PAT still needs revoking.~~ **Closed.** The user checked their
  token list and it is empty — the token no longer exists. See the resolution note
  at the top of this file. This had been carried as an open item since session 1
  purely on the strength of a note, never on a verified check.

## Sitemap

Rewritten. 91 → **93 URLs**, no duplicates, no malformed entries, and every URL
cross-checked against the real route tree on disk (0 sitemap URLs without a page,
0 indexable pages missing from the sitemap).

- Added `/privacy` and `/terms`. Both were indexable but absent.
- `/search` stays out: its metadata is `index: false`, and a noindex URL in a
  sitemap is a contradictory signal that wastes crawl budget.
- `lastModified` moved from one global constant to a per-section map, and the
  stale `2026-08-10` bumped to `2026-08-21` to match the content rewrites.
- `priority` was 0.9 or 0.85 on 90 of 91 URLs, which tells Bing and Yandex
  nothing. Now spread 1.0 / 0.9 / 0.8 / 0.7 / 0.6 / 0.5 / 0.3, ranked by measured
  GSC performance.

## Keyword SEO for drill pages

### The real gap was internal links, not meta keywords

Every drill page already had a `keywords` array (median 14 terms) and a
keyword-researched title. The `keywords` meta tag has been ignored by Google since
2009 and is a spam hint to Bing, so editing those arrays would have changed
nothing at all.

What was actually missing: **no drill page linked to any other drill page.** The
GSC URL Inspection API had shown 64 of 81 drill URLs with no referring URL at all.
Session 2 fixed the hubs, which gives each drill exactly one inbound link — still
a hub-and-spoke graph, with no keyword-bearing anchor text anywhere in it.

### What was built

**`lib/drillSeo.js`** — one curated entry per drill (81/81), each with:

- `term` — the primary search phrase, taken from the page's own researched title
- `anchor` — link text used when other pages link here, **unique across all 81**
- `also` — secondary phrases, used for relatedness scoring

Aligned to the measured 180-day GSC clusters: fps training 48 · fps practice 28 ·
fps trainer 16 · flick trainer 19 · flick training 17 · memory drill 19 · online
memory training 14 · drills online 42 · online drills 40 — plus long-tail with no
page targeting it yet (`fps warm up`, `cs2 jitter`, `apex legends jitter aim`,
`gridshot 3x3 online`).

**`lib/relatedDrills.js`** — deterministic selection: 2 same-subcategory, then 2
same-category, then a registry-order coverage slot, then cross-category by term
overlap. The coverage slot lays a cycle across all 81 drills so no drill can end
up with zero inbound drill links, however its terms happen to score.

**`components/drill/RelatedDrills.js`** — mounted once in `app/drills/layout.js`
and self-gating on the pathname, so hub pages are untouched. It is a client
component only to read `usePathname()`; everything it renders derives from the
static registry, so the markup is identical on server and client and the links
are in the initial HTML.

Anchor text is the target search phrase, not the product name. "Ghost-Link
Tracking" and "Triangular Pursuit" have no search volume; "Multiple Object
Tracking Test" and "Eye Tracking Accuracy Drill" do.

### Link graph, measured

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| drill → drill links | 0 | **486** |
| inbound drill links per drill | 0 | min 1, median 5, max 16 |
| drills with zero inbound drill links | 81 | **0** |
| cross-category share of links | — | 38.1% |
| unique `/drills/*` links in a drill page's HTML | ~2 | min 8, median 11, max 23 |
| median rendered words per drill page | 786 | **921** |

### Hub titles — each change justified by GSC

| Page | Before | After | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/drills` | All Training Drills - 81 Free Browser Drills | Free Online Drills - 81 Skill Training Drills | "online drills" 29 impr pos 14.7, "drills online" 23 pos 10.6 — phrase absent from title |
| `/drills/fps` | Free FPS Aim Trainer - Online Aim Training | Free FPS Aim Trainer - FPS Training & Aim Practice | "fps training" 48 impr pos 28.8, "fps practice" 28, "fps trainer" 16 |
| `/drills/memory` | Memory Training - 7 Free Drills | Online Memory Training - 7 Free Memory Drills | "online memory training" 14 pos 43.6, "memory training online" 11 pos 49.5 |
| `/drills/cognitive` | Free Brain Training - Focus & Attention | Free Brain Training Online - Focus, Attention & Speed | "train your brain online" pos 70.5 |
| `/drills/physical` | Free Reflex, Balance & Coordination Drills | Free Physical Drills - Reflex, Balance & Coordination | "physical drills" pos 9.0, "physical fitness drills" pos 50 |

Untouched on purpose: `/` (pos 5.5, 33% CTR, 181 of the site's 244 clicks — do
not touch it), plus `/drills/motor`, `/drills/visual`, `/drills/visual-tracking`
and `/drills/reaction-speed`, which already lead with their demand terms.

Also removed "typing speed test" from `app/drills/layout.js` keywords — that
section was deleted from the site.

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx next build` | compiled successfully, 180 static pages |
| `npm audit` | 0 vulnerabilities (was 6 high) |
| Security headers, live via `next start` | all present; `'unsafe-eval'` absent in prod |
| `POST /api/indexnow` abuse paths | 401 / 400 / 400 / 503, no relay fired |
| Sitemap | 93 URLs, 0 dupes, 0 dead, `/search` excluded |
| Related block in prerendered HTML | present on all 81 drill pages, absent on all 8 hubs |
| Drill link graph | 0 orphans |
| Anchor text uniqueness | 81/81 unique |

## NEXT

1. **Deploy.** Set `INDEXNOW_ADMIN_KEY` in Vercel env first, or leave the route
   disabled — which is safe.
2. Browser-check one drill page for hydration warnings. `RelatedDrills` is a pure
   function of the static registry so a mismatch is not possible in principle, but
   it has not been opened in a real browser.
3. GSC: resubmit the sitemap, then URL-inspect + Request Indexing for
   `/drills/fps`, `/drills/memory`, `/drills` and the top 10 drills.
4. Re-run `scratchpad/gsc_index.py` in ~3 weeks. The number to watch is
   "Discovered - currently not indexed" draining from 76.
5. Off-site work is still the actual constraint. Nothing on-page moves
   "aim trainer online" from position 65.

## SESSION 3 addendum — H1 keyword pass (deployed, `eb817b9`)

### The gap

Measured across all 81 drill pages before the change:

| H1 vs its target search phrase | Count |
|---|---|
| Contains the full phrase | 12 |
| Contains part of it (>=50% of words) | 25 |
| Contains **none** of it | **44** |

The H1 was the drill's product name. "TRIANGULAR PURSUIT", "GHOSTING SUPPRESS
PURSUIT", "PRO FLICK TRAINER" — names with no search volume occupying the
strongest on-page element after the title.

### The fix

The drill name stays the hero text; the keyword goes in as a second line inside
the same `<h1>`:

```jsx
<h1 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-black tracking-tight text-white">
  TRIANGULAR PURSUIT
  <span className="block text-sm font-semibold text-slate-400 mt-1
                   normal-case tracking-normal">
    Eye Tracking Accuracy Drill
  </span>
</h1>
```

The phrase is the existing `anchor` field from `lib/drillSeo.js` — already Title
Case, already unique across all 81 — so H1s, internal link anchor text and page
titles all name the same thing and cannot drift apart. `normal-case` and
`tracking-normal` stop the span inheriting the parent's uppercase and tight
tracking; the muted colour is whichever one that file's sibling `<p>` already used.

Applied by codemod to 68 files: **+204 lines, 0 deletions**, purely additive.

**13 pages were skipped deliberately** because their H1 already contained the
phrase — e.g. "Aim Trainer Elite" already says *aim trainer*, "JIGGLE PEEK
TRAINER" already says *jiggle peek trainer*. Adding it twice would be stuffing.

Where a sub-line looks redundant beside the name ("GRID MEMORIZATION" / "Grid
Memorization Test"), the added word is the query modifier people actually type.
That redundancy is the point, not an oversight.

Also: `/drills` H1 "All Training Hubs" -> "Free Online Drills". It was the last
hub H1 that was pure brand copy, on a URL taking 29 impressions for "online
drills" (pos 14.7) and 23 for "drills online" (pos 10.6).

### Result

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Drill H1s containing their full target phrase | 12 / 81 | **81 / 81** |
| Pages with exactly one H1 | all | all |
| Build | — | 180 static pages, compiled clean |

Verified live as Googlebot across all 8 categories after deploy.

### Gotcha for whoever verifies a deploy next

`skilldrills.online` serves prerendered HTML through Vercel's edge cache
(`X-Vercel-Cache: PRERENDER`). A plain `curl` right after a deploy can return the
**previous** build and make a good deploy look broken. Bust it:

```
curl -s -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" "https://skilldrills.online/drills?cb=$RANDOM"
```

And do not write a deploy-wait loop that greps for a phrase which also appears in
the page's `<title>` or in the RelatedDrills block — it will match the old build
and exit immediately. Grep for something unique to the new markup instead
(e.g. `data-seo-kw`).

# SESSION 4 — 2026-08-25 (Bing Webmaster connected + demand-driven keyword pass)

## Bing Webmaster Tools is now connected

API key supplied by the user. Stored in `scripts/bing/.bing-key`, which is
gitignored — the key is **not** in the repo and must not be committed.

> **Security note for the user:** this key was pasted into a chat message in
> plain text. Treat it as exposed and rotate it in Bing Webmaster Tools
> (Settings → API access) when convenient. Anyone holding it can read the site's
> full search data and spend its 100/day URL submission quota.

New puller: **`scripts/bing/bing.py`** (mirrors `scripts/gsc/gsc.py`)

```
python scripts/bing/bing.py sites | traffic [days] | queries [n] | pages [n]
                                  | pagequeries <url> | crawl | quota
                                  | keyword <phrase> | related <phrase>
                                  | submit <url>... | submitall [--dry]
```

Two API gotchas, both cost time:
- The traffic endpoints *return* dates as `/Date(1779433200000-0700)/`, but the
  keyword-research endpoints **reject** that format on input. They want plain
  ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`. Wrong format returns `ERROR!!! String was not recognized as
  a valid DateTime.`
- Bing rate-limits parallel keyword lookups and returns an **HTTP error**, not a
  zero. Six worker threads produced 152 failures out of 308 phrases. Anything
  that treats a failed call as "0 volume" will silently invent a conclusion.
  `keyword_volume()` returns `None` on error for exactly this reason; re-fetch
  serially with backoff before trusting a zero.

## The headline: Bing is now the bigger channel, and it behaves nothing like Google

| | Google (28d) | Bing (30d) |
|---|---|---|
| Clicks | 110 | **161** |
| Impressions | 1,926 | **2,435** |
| URLs earning impressions | **11** | **84** |
| Typical position on non-brand terms | 30–70 | **2–10** |

Bing has crawled and ranked the whole site; Google has effectively indexed the
hubs only. On Bing the site already sits on page 1 for real queries — and
converts almost none of them:

| Bing query | Impr | Pos | Clicks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `drill your skill` | 270 | 6.8 | **0** |
| `concentration grids` | 88 | 8.7 | **0** |
| `memory chart drill` | 65 | 3.0 | **0** |
| `drills` | 31 | 6.8 | **0** |
| `cognitive drills` | 29 | 4.8 | **0** |
| `steady hand game` | 27 | 7.0 | **0** |

Page-1 rankings with 0% CTR is a **title and description** problem, not a
ranking problem — and unlike the Google situation it is fixable on-page.

## Keyword research: the target map was built backwards

`lib/drillSeo.js` was derived from Search Console query clusters — i.e. from
phrases the site *already ranked for*. That is a survivorship filter, not a
demand measurement. Running every target term through Bing's keyword API:

- **26 of 81** drill target terms have measurable Bing exact volume.
- **55 of 81** register zero — they are real phrases, but nobody searches them.

(Zero on Bing is not literally zero searches. Bing is ~3–4% of the market and
its tool floors low-volume terms. It does mean the term carries no measurable
demand, and Google volume for these is proportionally small too.)

**36 pages had a better, honestly-matching term available.** The biggest:

| Page | Was | Vol | Now | Vol |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/drills/motor/movement-speed/rapid-tapping` | click speed test | 3,256 | **cps test** | **26,858** |
| `/drills/cognitive` | brain training | 68 | **brain games** | **4,249** |
| `/drills/memory` | memory training | 87 | **memory games** | **1,322** |
| `/drills/cognitive/focus/distraction-fighter` | focus game | 0 | **stroop test** | **427** |
| `/drills/cognitive/processing-speed/rsvp-reader` | rsvp speed reader | 0 | **reading speed test** | **250** |
| `/drills/motor/movement-speed/keyboard-recognition` | keybind speed trainer | 0 | **keyboard speed test** | **199** |
| `/drills/memory/short-term-memory/color-sequence` | color sequence memory game | 0 | **color memory game** | **172** |
| `/drills/cognitive/focus/concentration-grid` | concentration grid | 36 | **schulte table** | **149** |
| `/drills/physical/reflex-training/peripheral-threat-sweeper` | peripheral vision trainer | 0 | **peripheral vision test** | **106** |

`distraction-fighter` is literally a Stroop task ("identify ink colors while
ignoring conflicting word meanings") and `concentration-grid` is literally a
Schulte table. Those two were sitting on established, searched names and using
invented ones instead.

### Retargets deliberately rejected as dishonest

Volume is worthless if the page cannot satisfy the query. These scored well and
were **not** applied:

| Page | Rejected term | Vol | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `memory/working-memory/n-back` | dual n back | 146 | Drill is a single 3-back. "Dual" n-back means two simultaneous streams. |
| `physical/reflex-training/drop-catch` | ruler drop test | 7 | That is a specific physical ruler-catch protocol; this is a falling-ball click drill. |
| `motor/movement-speed/finger-sequencing` | finger tapping test | 27 | Drill is size-ordering 3 nodes, not tapping speed. |
| `visual/tracking-accuracy/multiple-targets` | mot test | 10 | "MOT test" is the UK vehicle inspection. Hopeless ambiguity. |
| `memory/spatial-memory/object-location` | memory matching game | 211 | Drill is spatial recall, not a pairs/Concentration matching game. |
| `physical/coordination/complex-pattern` | pattern recognition test | 54 | Drill is pattern *memory*, not recognition. |

Also note the raw Bing related-keyword pool is heavily polluted: `reflex` is
mostly medical (babinski, moro, TSH-reflex), `focus` is Ford Focus and school
portals, `sequence` is Fibonacci, `memory` is Windows memory diagnostic, and
`fps tester` means frame rate, not aim. Never take that pool at face value.

## Keyword cannibalisation fixed

Two hubs were competing with their own child drill for the same phrase:

| Hub | Was targeting | Conflicted with | Hub now targets |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/drills/motor` | aim trainer | `/drills/motor/hand-eye-coordination/aim-trainer` (9,821) | mouse precision / hand-eye coordination |
| `/drills/reaction-speed` | reaction time test | `/drills/reaction-speed/reaction-time-test` (10,978) | reaction training drills |

Search engines pick one page per query; two of ours competing splits the signal.

## 27 dead URLs redirected

Cross-checked every URL Bing reports impressions for against the route tree,
then confirmed each live. 27 returned 404 while carrying **95 impressions and 7
clicks**, and Bing logged **638 4xx responses / 1,891 crawl errors over 103
days** — a standing crawl-budget leak. All 27 now 301 to the nearest live drill.

Verified against a production build: 27/27 redirect, all destinations 200.

### A trap worth remembering

The first version of this included a case-normalising redirect
`/drills/physical/Reflex-Training/:path*` → `/drills/physical/reflex-training/:path*`
to catch a mixed-case URL Bing had crawled. **Next matches redirect sources
case-insensitively**, so that rule also matched the real lower-case URL and
308'd it to itself — an infinite loop on a live drill page. Caught by the
redirect smoke test, removed, and documented in `next.config.js`. Do not re-add
it; mixed-case handling belongs in middleware.

## llms.txt added

New `app/llms.txt/route.js`, prerendered static, served at `/llms.txt`.
Generated from `DRILLS` + `DRILL_SEO` so it cannot drift from the sitemap.
141 lines, 85 links: every drill with its search phrase as the label, its real
description, duration and difficulty, plus explicit "key facts for citation"
(free, no account, runs in browser, scores local, some drills desktop-only).

robots.js already allows the AI search crawlers. Being crawlable is necessary
but not sufficient — an assistant still has to work out which of 81
structurally-identical pages answers "free reaction time test". This hands it
the map.

## Verification (production build, 182 static pages)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx next build` | compiled clean, 182 static pages |
| Titles over 60 chars | **0** |
| Descriptions over 160 chars | **0** |
| Pages with no meta description | **0** |
| Duplicate titles | **0** |
| Pages without exactly one H1 | 1 (`/search`, noindex — correct) |
| Dead-URL redirects | 27/27 → 301, all destinations 200 |
| Redirect loops | 0 (one found and removed) |
| `drillSeo.js` anchor uniqueness | 81/81 unique, 0 duplicate terms |
| `/llms.txt` | static, 85 links, all 81 drills present |

Title / H1 sub-line / internal anchor text were moved together for all 12
retargeted drills, so the three signals still name the same phrase.

## NOT DONE — blocked on deploy

Nothing in this session is deployed. Per the established pattern the **user
deploys**. After deploy:

1. `python scripts/bing/bing.py submitall` — 100 URLs/day, 800/month quota.
   93 sitemap URLs fit in one day.
2. `python scripts/gsc/gsc.py submit` — resubmit the sitemap.
3. Google has no public "request indexing" API. The Indexing API only accepts
   `JobPosting` and `BroadcastEvent`; using it for ordinary pages violates its
   terms and does nothing. Sitemap resubmission plus the internal-link mesh is
   the legitimate path, with manual URL Inspection in the GSC UI for the top
   10 pages if the user wants to push individual URLs.

## The honest read, updated

Bing rewards this site and Google does not, and the gap is authority, not
on-page work. Google has 11 URLs earning impressions after every on-page fix of
sessions 1–3 was deployed; Bing has 84. The on-page work in this session is
worth doing — the CPS retarget alone addresses a 26,858/mo phrase the site was
ranking adjacent to — but the constraint on the 100k/month goal is still
off-site: links, distribution, and time.

---

## SESSION 4 — SHIPPED AND SUBMITTED (2026-08-25)

Unlike sessions 1–3, this work **is deployed**. Both PRs merged.

| PR | What | Merge commit |
|---|---|---|
| #1 | Bing-demand keyword retarget, 27 dead-URL redirects, llms.txt | `c425f0a` |
| #2 | Per-URL sitemap `lastModified` | `7e12113` |

### Verified on production (cache-busted)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Retargeted titles serving | 9/9 — e.g. `CPS Test - Free Click Speed Test & Clicks Per Second` |
| `/llms.txt` | 200, `text/plain; charset=utf-8`, 17,755 bytes |
| Dead-URL redirects | 26/26 → 308 → destination 200 |
| Redirect-loop guard | `/drills/physical/reflex-training/quick-dodge` → 200 |
| Live sitemap | 94 URLs; 73 @ 08-21, 3 @ 08-22, **18 @ 08-25** (exactly the pages edited) |

### Index submission — done

- **Bing:** all 94 sitemap URLs submitted via `bing.py submitall`. Quota confirms
  it landed: daily 100 → 6, monthly 700 → 606.
- **Google:** sitemap resubmitted via `gsc.py submit` (the write token now
  exists; `gsc.py authwrite` was run by the user). GSC shows
  `submitted 2026-08-25T01:27:11Z`, `pending True`. The `urls 93` figure is the
  stale count from Google's last *download* (2026-08-21) and will become 94 when
  it re-fetches.

### A mistake made and corrected mid-session

The first version of the sitemap change bumped the **section-level** `drill`
date, which claimed all 81 drills had changed when only 12 had. That sends
crawlers to recrawl 69 byte-identical pages and is exactly how a sitemap trains
Google to discount its own freshness field — the thing rule 3 in `app/sitemap.js`
exists to prevent. Fixed in PR #2 with per-URL `UPDATED_OVERRIDES`. A second
bug surfaced from that fix: with the changed hubs listed individually, leaving
`UPDATED.hub` at the new date made `/drills/visual` inherit a bump it never
earned, because it resolves through the fallback (there is no `UPDATED['visual']`
key). Both caught by auditing the built sitemap rather than trusting the diff.

### What to watch, and where

**Watch Bing first, and expect movement in days-to-weeks.** It has 84 URLs
earning impressions at positions 2–10, so the retargeted titles are converting
rankings the site already holds. Re-measure with:

```
python scripts/bing/bing.py traffic 30
python scripts/bing/bing.py queries 40
python scripts/bing/bing.py pages 40
python scripts/bing/bing.py crawl        # 4xx count should fall from 638
```

The specific numbers to beat: `concentration grids` 88 impr @ 8.7 with 0 clicks,
`memory chart drill` 65 @ 3.0 with 0 clicks, `cognitive drills` 29 @ 4.8 with 0
clicks. If CTR on those stays at zero after 3–4 weeks, the titles are not the
constraint and the next hypothesis should be SERP presentation (descriptions,
sitelinks) rather than more keyword work.

**Do not read a flat Google line as failure.** Google has 11 URLs earning
impressions against Bing's 84, at positions 30–70 on commercial terms. Every
crawlability fix is already shipped; the remaining constraint there is domain
authority. Submitting URLs cannot move it.

```
python scripts/gsc/gsc.py pages 28 20
python scratchpad/gsc_index.py           # watch "Discovered - not indexed" drain
```

### Still open

- **Rotate the Bing API key.** It was pasted in plain-text chat. Bing Webmaster
  Tools → Settings → API access. Then update `scripts/bing/.bing-key`.
- **The `global-drill-system-app` Vercel project fails on every commit**
  ("Git author foryouoffside-lab must have access to the project on Vercel").
  It has been red since at least `eb817b9`, so the repo currently has no usable
  CI signal. Either grant that account access in that Vercel team, or disconnect
  the project from this repo if it is dead.
- Off-site work remains the real constraint on the 100k/month goal. Nothing
  on-page moves `aim trainer online` from position 65.

# SESSION 5 — 2026-09-02 (mobile pass — drill header trimmed to two lines)

## The Session 3 H1 keyword line is intact; the descriptive tagline under it is gone

Drill headers were three stacked lines on a phone — name, target search phrase,
then a descriptive tagline — before any content. The tagline (`<p class="text-xs
text-slate-400 mt-1">`, e.g. "Dual-Task Target Tracking & Numerical Match
Stream") was removed from all 80 pages that had one. It was decorative copy that
appeared in no measured query.

**The `data-seo-kw` span stays on all 75 pages that carry it.** It is the one
line in the header that earns anything, so H1 keyword coverage is unchanged:

| | Session 3 → 4 | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Drill H1s containing their full target phrase | 81 / 81 | 81 / 81 |
| `data-seo-kw` spans in the tree | 75 | 75 |
| Descriptive `<p>` taglines under the H1 | 80 | 0 |

Word count per drill page drops by roughly 6-9 words. Nothing else on-page moved.
