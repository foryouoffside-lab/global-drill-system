**Auditor / Engineer:** Antigravity (Technical SEO)  
**Target Domain:** `skilldrills.online`

## 1. Executive Summary

A structured-data audit identified that out of 81 drill pages emitting `FAQPage` JSON-LD schema, 15 pages suffered from content drift where advertised questions were missing from the server-rendered DOM. In total, **138 Q&A pairs** were advertised in JSON-LD schema that no user could see.

Per Google Search Central guidelines, FAQ content in structured data must be completely visible to users on the page. Concealed or drifted schema risks page-level rich result revocation and site-wide structured-data manual penalties.

### Summary of Actions
- **Total Defective Pages Identified & Fixed:** 15 pages across 5 categories (`reaction-speed`, `physical`, `cognitive`, `fps`, `memory`).
- **Clean Pages Preserved:** 66 pages were verified clean before work began and remained completely untouched.
- **Original Missing Questions:** 138 Q&As.
- **Questions Retained & Added to Visible DOM:** 43 high-value, factually defensible questions.
- **Questions Pruned from Schema:** 95 low-value, duplicate, or keyword-stuffed questions.
- **Drifted Pages Remaining:** **0** (verified across all 89 compiled HTML drill pages in `.next/server/app/drills/`).
- **Cloaking / Hidden Text:** **0** hidden text, CSS concealment, or zero-opacity containers introduced.

## 4. Truthfulness Gate Audit (§4.2)

Every retained and newly published answer was reviewed to ensure it contains only factually defensible claims. All fabricated statistics, unmeasured sample sizes, and false precision promises were stripped across all pages:

### Key Quotes Deleted / Corrected:
1. **"Sub-millisecond precision"**:
   - *Original Claim:* Advertised browser clock timer resolution down to fractions of a millisecond.
   - *Action:* Completely removed. Replaced with honest technical disclosure that modern browsers intentionally coarsen `performance.now()` to ~1ms (and introduce jitter) as standard Spectre/timing-attack mitigations.
2. **"Zero input lag"**:
   - *Original Claim:* Guaranteed zero input latency in the web browser.
   - *Action:* Deleted. Replaced with accurate explanation of the browser rendering pipeline (display refresh intervals, OS USB polling rates, and compositing latency).
3. **"Benchmarks calibrated across millions of visual reaction trials"**:
   - *Original Claim:* Claimed statistical percentiles based on millions of internal platform runs.
   - *Action:* Deleted. The site has ~80 clicks/mo and has never conducted a multi-million-trial study. Benchmark ranges were either attributed to established scientific literature (e.g., standard simple reaction time physiology ~200-250ms) or explicitly labeled as editorial training bands.
4. **"Official Human Visual Reaction Time Benchmarks"**:
   - *Original Claim:* Labeled standard tables as "Official".
   - *Action:* Struck the word "Official". Framed as an editorial reference guide.

```

### 5.2 Build Status
`npx next build` completed with exit code 0. Zero compiler errors, zero schema serialization issues.

### 5.3 Architectural Invariant Preservation
1. `components/drill/DrillAccordion.js` was **not modified**. Collapsed accordions continue to use standard HTML `hidden` attributes rather than conditional mounting, ensuring full server-render crawler accessibility.
2. `Pattern B` (`faqs: faqSchema.mainEntity.map(...)`) was adopted across the `reaction-speed` category so schema and visible accordion items originate from one single data structure. Future drift between schema and visible DOM is programmatically impossible.
