// Difficulty is UNBOUNDED. There is no level ceiling and no terminal
// difficulty: `getDifficultyProgress` rises linearly forever, and drills scale
// their parameters off it with an exponential decay toward floors they never
// reach. A run therefore always ends eventually — the drill outruns the player,
// rather than plateauing and letting a strong player continue indefinitely.
//
// `MAX_LEVEL` is NOT a clamp. It is the reference span every drill's per-level
// tuning was authored against: progress runs 0 -> 1 across levels 1..15 exactly
// as before, so the opening of every drill feels unchanged. Past level 15 the
// curve simply keeps going at the same slope instead of flattening out.

 * end no matter how skilled the player is.
 *

/**
 * Warm-up easing applied to `p` before the exponential.
 *
 * A raw `exp(-DECAY * p)` is FRONT-LOADED: its slope is steepest at p = 0, so
 * the very first level transition is the harshest one in the whole curve.
 * Level 1 -> 2 used to consume 9.7% of the start->floor range while level
 * 14 -> 15 consumed only 2.6% — a 3.8x spread, felt in play as a difficulty
 * wall the moment the player left level 1 and near-nothing thereafter.
 *
 * `EASE_A` shapes a quadratic warm-up that starts slow and accelerates:
 *
 *     ease(p) = p * (p + a) / (1 + a)          for p <= 1
 *
 * Two properties make this safe to drop under every existing drill:
 *
 *  - `ease(1) === 1` exactly, so `ramp()` at level 15 returns precisely what it
 *    returned before. Every drill's authored FLOOR/START pair still lands on its
 *    tuned level-15 value and no drill needs retuning.
 *  - `ease` is monotonic and C-1 continuous, so difficulty still only ever rises
 *    and the hand-off at p = 1 has no kink.
 *
 * Past p = 1 it continues as a straight line at the slope it reached there
 * (`EASE_SLOPE_AT_1`), which keeps the curve unbounded — a run must still end.
 *
 * Net effect on per-level steps across levels 1..15:
 *
 *     L1->2    9.71%  ->  4.20%
 *     L7->8    5.26%  ->  6.27%   (the new worst case)
 *     L14->15  2.57%  ->  4.19%
 *
 * i.e. the spread drops from 3.8x to 1.5x and the worst single step drops from
 * 9.7% to 6.3%.
