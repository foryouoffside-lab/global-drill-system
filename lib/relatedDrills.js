// lib/relatedDrills.js
// Picks the drills to cross-link from any given drill page.
//
// The point of this is crawl reachability, not decoration. The GSC URL
// Inspection API showed 64 of 81 drill URLs with no referring URL at all — the
// hubs were the only thing that ever linked to a drill, and they were rendering
// a loading skeleton. Even with the hubs fixed, a hub-and-spoke graph gives
// every drill exactly one inbound link. Cross-linking drills to each other turns
// that into a mesh, so a crawler that lands on any one drill can reach the rest,
// and each link carries the keyword-bearing anchor text from lib/drillSeo.js.
//
// Selection is deliberately mixed rather than purely "most similar": a slice of
// same-subcategory neighbours (closest topical match), then same-category, then
// cross-category by term overlap. A pure similarity ranking collapses into
// category silos, which is exactly the shape that left the orphans unreachable.
//
// Output is a pure function of the registry, so it is identical on the server
// and the client and cannot cause a hydration mismatch.
