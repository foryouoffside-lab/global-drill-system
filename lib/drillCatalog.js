// lib/drillCatalog.js
// Card-level presentation data for the hub pages: a one-line subtitle per drill,
// and the order drills are offered in.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// 1. TAGLINES. `lib/drillsRegistry.js` descriptions are written for the drill
//    page itself — they carry parameters ("adaptive 100-200ms window", "opacity
//    1.0 -> 0.4") because a visitor already on that page wants them. On a hub
//    card they wrap to three or four lines on a phone and turn the grid into a
//    wall of text, which is the opposite of what a card is for. The tagline is
//    the same drill said in one line: what you actually do, no numbers.
//    The long description is untouched and still used on the drill page.
//
// 2. ORDER. `FEATURED_ORDER` decides which drill a visitor is shown first.
//    Where a page's target term has measured Bing volume (see docs/SEO_PROGRESS.md
//    "Keyword research" and scripts/bing/baseline/), demand sets the order:
//      cps test 26,858 · reaction time test 10,978 · aim trainer 9,821 ·
//      stroop test 427 · reading speed test 250 · keyboard speed test 199 ·
//      color memory game 172 · schulte table 149 · peripheral vision test 106
//    55 of 81 drill terms register no measurable volume, so for those the order
//    is a judgement call, and the rule applied is: a drill a first-time visitor
//    can understand from its one-line subtitle comes before one that needs a
//    paragraph. It is an editorial ranking, not a measurement — say so before
//    treating this list as data.
