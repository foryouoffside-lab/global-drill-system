// WHY THIS PAGE EXISTS
// Both Google's quality guidance and every current answer engine weight who is
// making a claim, not just the claim. This site was an anonymous domain with no
// About page and no contact route, which caps how often it gets cited no matter
// how good the drill pages are.
//
// The honest version of "who we are" here is short, and that is fine. What this
// page can do well is the part most tool sites skip: state exactly how a
// measurement is taken, what it cannot control, and what is never collected.
// Method transparency is a genuine trust signal and it costs nothing but candour.
//
// NOTHING ON THIS PAGE MAY BE EMBELLISHED. No team size, no credentials, no user
// counts, no ratings -- the site collects no aggregate data and has no such
// figures. If a byline is ever added it must be a real person who consents to it.

            SkillDrills is a free, independent training site with {DRILL_COUNT} browser drills for
            reaction speed, aim, visual tracking, memory, focus and motor control. Everything runs
            in the browser with no account, no download and no payment, and no score you record is

          <Section title="How the drills measure">
            <p>
              Every drill records events using the browser&apos;s{' '}
              <code className="text-slate-300 font-mono text-[12px]">performance.now()</code>{' '}
              high-resolution clock, entirely on your own device. Rendering runs on a canvas driven
              by <code className="text-slate-300 font-mono text-[12px]">requestAnimationFrame</code>,
              so the drill is paced by your display rather than by a fixed timer.
            </p>
            <p>
              What that measurement contains is you <em>plus your hardware</em>. It is not a
              laboratory instrument, and three things it cannot separate out are worth knowing
              before you read anything into a score:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5 marker:text-slate-600">
              <li>
                <span className="text-slate-300">Timer resolution.</span> Browsers deliberately
                coarsen high-resolution timers as a Spectre-era side-channel mitigation &mdash;
                typically to around 1&nbsp;ms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="text-slate-300">Display quantization.</span> A stimulus cannot
                appear between frames. That is about 16.7&nbsp;ms per frame at 60&nbsp;Hz,
                6.9&nbsp;ms at 144&nbsp;Hz and 4.1&nbsp;ms at 240&nbsp;Hz.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="text-slate-300">Input polling.</span> A mouse polling at
                125&nbsp;Hz reports a click up to about 8&nbsp;ms late; at 1000&nbsp;Hz, about
                1&nbsp;ms.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Taken together, that means a drill here resolves real differences of roughly
              5&nbsp;ms and upward. Treat anything finer as measurement noise, and compare your own
              runs on the same machine rather than your number against someone else&apos;s on
              different hardware. Any site claiming sub-millisecond precision from a web browser is
              overstating what the platform can do.

              Because of that, this site has no aggregate performance statistics and will never

              The benchmark tables on drill pages are labelled as editorial guides drawn from
              published literature, not as norms measured from visitors.
