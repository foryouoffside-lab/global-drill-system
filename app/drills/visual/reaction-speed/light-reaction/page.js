  intro: [
    "The Light Reaction test measures simple visual reaction time: the milliseconds between a light appearing and your response. Wait for the signal, react as fast as you can, and compare your times across rounds on the same device. Healthy adults typically react in roughly 200 to 250 ms, and screen and input lag add to the result.",
    "Simple reaction time (SRT) represents the elementary psychomotor latency between the sudden presentation of a solitary visual stimulus and the execution of an unconditioned motor release. In track sprinting, combat sports, motorsports, and competitive esports, millisecond differences in visual stimulus transduction govern defensive evasion, starting-block clearance, and immediate counter-play.",
    "The neuromuscular cascade underlying light reaction spans four distinct physiological stages: (1) retinal phototransduction (~20–40 ms as photons trigger rhodopsin isomerization), (2) afferent transmission along optic tract axons via the lateral geniculate nucleus to primary visual cortex V1 (~30–50 ms), (3) cortical perceptual and motor preparation within posterior parietal and supplementary motor areas (~50–80 ms), and (4) efferent corticospinal motor transmission descending the pyramidal tract to contract the digital flexor muscles (~30–50 ms), establishing the natural healthy baseline of ~200–250 ms (Kosinski, 2008; Jain et al., 2015; Shelton & Kumar, 2010).",
    "According to Piéron's Law (Piéron, 1952; Pins & Bonnet, 1996), reaction latency decreases as a hyperbolic function of stimulus luminance and contrast above background levels. This drill operationalizes Piéron's Law by projecting an ultra-high-contrast stark white strobe against an absorbing dark canvas, generating maximal transient ganglion cell depolarization to minimize sensory transduction overhead. Michael Posner's covert attention orienting paradigms (1980) and Daphne Bavelier's action video game studies (Dye, Green, & Bavelier, 2009) demonstrate that focused spatial anticipation can further compress cortical motor planning latency.",
    "Timing & Measurement Methodology: All visual presentations and user input releases are recorded client-side via the high-resolution performance.now() API. Hardware latency adds display frame quantization (~16.7 ms at 60 Hz, ~6.9 ms at 144 Hz, ~4.1 ms at 240 Hz) and input polling intervals (~8 ms at 125 Hz vs ~1 ms at 1,000 Hz), as documented by Woods et al. (2015). All scores, level progressions, and latency histories remain stored entirely in your local browser storage with zero external tracking."
