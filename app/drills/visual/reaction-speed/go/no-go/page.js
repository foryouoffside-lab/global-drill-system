    "Response inhibition represents the cornerstone executive faculty that allows humans to actively cancel, delay, or withhold actions that are no longer appropriate or advantageous. In tactical combat sports, competitive gaming, high-speed driving, and everyday decision-making, the ability to rapidly suppress a prepotent, reflexive motor action is often far more critical than raw movement velocity.",
    "The Go/No-Go paradigm traces its psychophysical origins to Franciscus Cornelis Donders (1868), who introduced the seminal 'C-reaction' subtraction method in mental chronometry. Donders demonstrated that presenting two distinct stimuli while instructing participants to respond to only one requires an additional layer of cognitive discrimination and selective motor withholding compared to simple reaction time.",
    "In 1984, Gordon D. Logan and colleagues formulated the 'Horse-Race Model' of response inhibition, demonstrating that behavioral restraint reflects an active computational contest between a sensory Go process and an inhibitory Stop process. Contemporary functional neuroimaging (Aron et al., 2014) confirms that this inhibitory brake is executed via a dedicated hyperdirect pathway connecting the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC), presupplementary motor area, and subthalamic nucleus (STN).",
    "Timing & Measurement Methodology: All stimulus presentations and motor click events are captured client-side using the high-resolution performance.now() API. Hardware latency adds display frame quantization (~16.7 ms at 60 Hz, ~6.9 ms at 144 Hz, ~4.1 ms at 240 Hz) and input polling intervals (~8 ms at 125 Hz vs ~1 ms at 1,000 Hz), as documented by Woods et al. (2015). All scores and error tracking remain strictly confined to your local browser storage with zero telemetry."
