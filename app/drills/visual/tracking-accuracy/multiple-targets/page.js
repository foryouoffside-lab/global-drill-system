  intro: [
    "Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a foundational cognitive psychophysics paradigm first formalized by Zenon Pylyshyn and Ron Storm (1988) to investigate how the human visual architecture maintains real-time spatial representations of independent moving items. Real-world visual environments—such as fast team sports, chaotic driving intersections, and tactical gaming—rarely present solitary focal stimuli; instead, they demand continuous parallel monitoring of multiple entities dispersed across the visual field.",
    "Prior to the MOT paradigm, classical models of visual attention posited a single movable 'spotlight' that sequentially scanned items. Pylyshyn and Storm demonstrated that human observers can track 4 to 5 identical moving items in parallel without scanning, establishing the theory of visual indexing ('FINSTs' or Fingers of Instantiation). FINSTs function as pre-attentive mental pointers that stick to objects and continuously track their spatial coordinates through dense motion, independent of object properties like color or shape.",
    "Subsequent neuroimaging and psychophysical research by Patrick Cavanagh and George Alvarez (2004, 2005) revealed that attentional tracking is mediated by independent multifocal spotlights divided across the left and right cerebral hemispheres. When target objects are distributed across both visual hemifields, tracking capacity is substantially higher than when all targets are confined to a single hemifield, demonstrating that each hemisphere possesses dedicated tracking resources.",
    "In applied performance research, Daphne Bavelier and C. Shawn Green (2006) showed that action video game players exhibit significantly expanded MOT tracking capacities, successfully tracking 6 to 7 simultaneous items compared to 3 to 4 for non-gamers. Similarly, Jocelyn Faubert (2013) demonstrated that elite professional athletes (NHL, English Premier League) possess extraordinary 3D-MOT dynamic scene tracking abilities that rapidly adapt to escalating kinematic velocity, linking MOT capacity directly to elite spatial decision-making under pressure."
