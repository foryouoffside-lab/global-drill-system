Saccades are rapid, ballistic jumps (up to 900 deg/s) driven by positional displacement to re-acquire off-center targets."

  intro: [
    "Dynamic target interception is an essential perceptual-motor capability across fast-paced sports, aviation, martial arts, and competitive esports. Successfully striking an accelerating, non-linear moving object requires simultaneous execution of smooth pursuit eye movements, predictive trajectory extrapolation, and precise closed-loop motor timing.",
    "The neurobiology of visual motion tracking originates in specialized directionally-selective neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT/V5) and medial superior temporal area (MST). These cortical regions compute target velocity vectors and transmit feedforward signals to the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the dorsolateral pontine nucleus, which in turn drive cerebellar purkinje cells to maintain ocular pursuit gain (Krauzlis, 2004).",
    "In his classic psychophysical paper, Rashbass (1961) demonstrated that smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements operate under independent control mechanisms: pursuit is modulated by target retinal velocity error, whereas saccades correct positional displacement. When targets accelerate beyond 30 to 40 deg/s or ricochet off viewport boundaries, smooth pursuit gain degrades, necessitating rapid corrective catch-up saccades (Bahill et al., 1980).",
    "Furthermore, research by Land & McLeod (2000) on athletic ball striking shows that human experts do not continuously track an object through its entire trajectory; instead, they make anticipatory saccades to future bounce points and intercept windows. This drill trains that exact predictive spatial capability under millisecond temporal pressure."
