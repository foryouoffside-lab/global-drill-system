  intro: [
    "A Schulte table is a grid of shuffled numbers that you tap in ascending order as fast as you can, a classic test of visual search speed and attention. This free online version expands from 3x3 to 8x8 inside one continuous 45-second run, so you practise scanning, not just one fixed grid.",
    "The Schulte table is a seminal psychodiagnostic paradigm developed by German psychiatrist Walter Schulte (1962) to measure visual search efficiency, selective attention allocation, and mental fatigue resistance. In its traditional implementation, numbers from 1 to 25 are randomly dispersed across a 5x5 grid, requiring the subject to locate each numeral in strict ascending sequence while attempting to hold visual fixation near the grid center.",
    "In applied sports psychology, the exercise evolved into the 'concentration grid' (Harris & Harris, 1984), widely used by elite coaches in tennis, baseball, and motor sports to train visual scanning velocity and present-moment cognitive discipline under timed stress. An event-related potential study of 27 children aged 8-11 searching Schulte grids found that searching for numbers in sequence took longer than locating a single target, and that adding a second colour slowed both, with matching differences in the recorded ERP signal (Lu et al., 2022).",
    "The SkillDrills Schulte Table Trainer elevates this classic protocol into a modern dynamic continuous performance task. Rather than presenting an isolated static matrix, the drill dynamically expands the grid architecture from 3x3 up to 8x8 as each stage is completed, while introducing rotational perturbations from 5x5 onward. This tests the outer limits of your perceptual span and foveal-parafoveal coordination within a fixed 45-second window.",
    "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes each change to its refresh interval, about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup.",
    "Data transparency: SkillDrills collects no aggregate data. Your scores and settings live only in your browser's localStorage and are never uploaded, so this site publishes no user averages, percentiles or player counts. Every figure quoted here comes from the published work in the References panel below.",
    "This drill is a free browser game for practice and interest. It is not a medical device, a diagnostic instrument, or a screening or treatment tool for any condition, and no score here says anything about your health. If you have concerns about your attention, memory or thinking, speak to a qualified clinician."
