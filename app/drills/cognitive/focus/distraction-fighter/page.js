    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why are humans so easily distracted?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Humans have an evolved orienting reflex that automatically directs attention toward novel, moving, or salient stimuli — a survival mechanism to detect threats and opportunities. In modern environments, this reflex is constantly triggered by notifications, movement, and bright colors, undermining voluntary focus. Training inhibitory control helps you override this reflex." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the Stroop test and how does it measure distraction resistance?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Stroop test (1935) requires naming the ink color of color words printed in conflicting colors (e.g., the word 'RED' in blue ink). The interference between the automatic reading response and the voluntary color-naming response measures your cognitive inhibition strength. A longer reaction time or more errors indicates stronger Stroop interference — weaker distraction resistance." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is inhibitory control and why does it matter?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Inhibitory control is the executive function that suppresses automatic, habitual, or impulse-driven responses in favor of more deliberate, goal-directed actions. It is essential for resisting distractions, suppressing irrelevant memories, controlling impulsive behavior, and maintaining task focus. It is one of the three core executive functions alongside working memory and cognitive flexibility." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How can I train my brain to block out distractions?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Effective methods include: (1) Stroop test and Flanker task practice (strengthens top-down inhibitory pathways), (2) mindfulness meditation (increases prefrontal cortex gray matter density), (3) single-tasking practice (training sustained focus without device interruptions), and (4) progressive exposure to distractor-rich environments during deliberate practice. This drill provides direct gamified inhibitory control exercise." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the Flanker task and how does it relate to distraction?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Eriksen Flanker Task displays a central target surrounded by congruent (same direction) or incongruent (opposite direction) flanker stimuli. The incongruent condition creates response competition — your brain must inhibit the incorrect flanker response to respond correctly to the central target. This resistance to flanker distraction is precisely what this game trains." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can distraction-resistance training help with open-office productivity?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Workers in open offices face continuous visual and auditory distractors. Training inhibitory control makes it cognitively cheaper to suppress peripheral visual movement (colleagues walking), auditory interruptions, and environmental noise, allowing deeper sustained focus during critical work intervals." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the orienting reflex and how does it cause distraction?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The orienting reflex is an automatic neurological response to novel stimuli — your brain involuntarily redirects attention to unexpected sounds, movement, or visual changes. Mediated by the superior colliculus and thalamus, it evolved to ensure threat detection. Inhibitory control training helps the prefrontal cortex override this reflex when distraction is unhelpful." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does this distraction fighter game work?",
      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A color word flashes on screen printed in a conflicting ink color (e.g. the word 'BLUE' printed in red ink). You must tap the button matching the ink color, not the word's meaning, suppressing the automatic urge to read the word aloud. Each correct ink-color tap builds your score, while a wrong tap or a timed-out trial counts as an impulse control failure." }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",

      "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "No. This is a free browser game, not a medical device, a diagnostic instrument, or a treatment for any condition. Stroop tasks are used in research and in clinical settings, but this is not a clinical version, and your score here says nothing about whether you or anyone else has ADHD.

  intro: [
    "The Stroop task asks you to name the colour a word is printed in while ignoring the word itself. When the two disagree -- the word RED printed in blue -- responses slow down and errors rise. Stroop reported the effect in 1935, and it has proved one of the most robust results in experimental psychology (Stroop, 1935).",
    "Half a century of follow-up work established that the interference is essentially universal in healthy adults, that it shrinks with practice but never disappears, and that it is asymmetric: colour never interferes with reading the way reading interferes with colour naming (MacLeod, 1991). Reading is the more automatic process, so it wins unless inhibition holds it back -- and stopping a response you have already begun is its own process, racing the one that started it (Logan &amp; Cowan, 1984).",
    "Timing methodology: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device. Browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes each change to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup.",

    "This drill is a free browser game for practice and interest. It is not a medical device, a diagnostic instrument, or a screening or treatment tool for any condition, and no score here says anything about your health. If you have concerns about your attention, memory or thinking, speak to a qualified clinician.",
