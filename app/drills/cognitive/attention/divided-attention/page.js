        "text": "Divided attention is the cognitive ability to allocate mental resources across two or more independent information channels concurrently. This test measures your ability to simultaneously track moving visuospatial targets while categorizing a continuous numerical stream, quantifying cross-channel accuracy, response latency, and dual-task degradation under time pressure."

        "text": "The Psychological Refractory Period (Pashler, 1994) is the brief delay in processing that occurs when a second stimulus is presented shortly after a first.

        "text": "Christopher Wickens (2002) demonstrated that humans can divide attention far more effectively when concurrent tasks use distinct sensory modalities and processing codes.
