  intro: [
    "Spatial Shift Pursuit is a free browser drill where a target changes speed and direction suddenly while its path shifts in space. You re-lock onto the target after each shift and keep following it. Set the speed and duration, press start, and track the target.",
    "Smooth pursuit tracking in real-world scenarios rarely takes place across static, predictable backgrounds. Whether navigating high-speed automotive turns, sprint accelerations, or fast-paced tactical FPS shootouts characterized by aggressive screen shake and camera flicks, the observer's visual reference frame can displace or rotate instantaneously (Krauzlis, 2004; Robinson, 1965). Holding a high-priority target locked within the central fovea under these disruptive conditions demands adaptive oculomotor agility: Spatial Shift Pursuit.",
    "Seminal investigations by Findlay & Gilchrist (1999) and Kahlon & Lisberger (1996) demonstrated that visual motion inputs are initially registered in eye-centered (retinotopic) coordinate systems. When the entire visual environment undergoes a sudden frame shift, retinotopic coordinates break down. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) intervenes by integrating retinal signals with efference copy motor commands to execute rapid coordinate transformations into head-centered (craniotopic) and space-fixed (allocentric) reference maps.",
    "Driven by this remapped spatial representation, the central nervous system deploys a synchronized two-stage response: first, a high-velocity ballistic catch-up saccade (peaking up to 500°/s) closes the spatial gap to the remapped target position. Instantaneously upon saccadic landing, the oculomotor apparatus must execute a seamless pursuit handshake—matching the target's current velocity vector without hesitation (Rashbass, 1961). Spatial Shift Pursuit systematically trains this critical neuromuscular circuit to ensure uninterrupted target tracking."
