  heading: "Momentum Teleport Pursuit - Ocular Motor Training Standards",
  intro: [
    "In natural dynamic environments, targets do not always move along unbroken, predictable paths. Rapid object deflections, sudden spatial repositioning, and visual occlusions force the human visual system to constantly coordinate two distinct ocular motor subsystems: ballistic saccades to locate the displaced object, and smooth pursuit to match its continuous velocity (Rashbass, 1961; Findlay & Walker, 1999).",
    "Momentum Teleport Pursuit isolates this exact neuromuscular mechanism. The target's spatial coordinates jump abruptly across the screen while its directional velocity vector is conserved. To excel, your oculomotor system must execute an accurate catch-up saccade to re-center the fovea, then instantaneously engage feedforward smooth pursuit to track the target without velocity lag (Bahill et al., 1980; Barnes, 2008).",
    "Hardware latency adds display quantization (~16.7 ms at 60 Hz, ~6.9 ms at 144 Hz) and input polling intervals (~8 ms at 125 Hz vs ~1 ms at 1,000 Hz), as documented by Woods et al. (2015). All scores remain stored strictly in local browser storage."
