  intro: [
    "Split-Screen Tracking is a free divided attention test in your browser. Two targets move at once, one on a horizontal path and one on a vertical path, and you track both at the same time. Choose a speed and duration, press start, and keep both targets in view.",
    "The human visual apparatus is physiologically constrained by the microscopic dimensions of the fovea centralis, which covers a high-acuity field of only 1 to 2 degrees. When two distinct targets move concurrently across spatially separated planes, optical foveation of both points simultaneously is biologically impossible. The central nervous system faces an executive dilemma: oscillate gaze rhythmically via ballistic saccades, or establish a central gaze anchor and expand covert spatial attention bimodally across both visual hemifields.",
    "Seminal multiple object tracking (MOT) research by Pylyshyn & Storm (1988) demonstrated that the primate brain utilizes visual indexing mechanisms (FINSTs) to track multiple entities concurrently without serial focal scanning. Expanding on this, Alvarez & Cavanagh (2005) proved that visual tracking resources are segregated across the cerebral hemispheres: dividing one target to the left visual field (right hemisphere) and one to the right visual field (left hemisphere) yields a measurable 'bilateral field advantage', avoiding intra-hemispheric attentional bottlenecks.",
    "Oscillating gaze rapidly between separated nodes imposes significant neurological overhead. Each saccadic transit incurs a latency of 20 to 50 milliseconds and triggers saccadic suppression—a brief threshold elevation during which visual processing is partially blind. Split-Screen Tracking conditions a stable central anchor coupled with multifocal covert attention (Cavanagh & Alvarez, 2005; Green & Bavelier, 2006). By coupling a vertical trajectory on the left with a horizontal trajectory on the right, this drill prevents Gestalt common fate grouping and trains true dual-stream cognitive processing."
