  heading: "Strobe Prediction Pursuit - Stroboscopic Occlusion & Velocity Memory Standards",
  intro: [
    "Stroboscopic visual training represents an empirically validated neuro-visual intervention wherein continuous visual input is periodically interrupted by brief intervals of total occlusion. By removing uninterrupted sensory feedback, the central nervous system is compelled to operate on incomplete motion datasets, forcing cerebellar and cortical networks to compute proactive forward internal models of target kinematics (Appelbaum et al., 2011; Mitroff et al., 2013).",
    "When a moving target plunges into a dark phase, retinal slip drops instantly to zero. In untrained individuals, smooth pursuit decelerates and arrests within 100 to 200 milliseconds, deteriorating into chaotic searching saccades upon re-emergence. Seminal investigations by Bennett et al. (2007) revealed that targeted occlusion protocols condition velocity memory pathways within the frontal eye fields (FEF) and cerebellar flocculus, allowing extraocular drive to persist across dark gaps and accelerate smoothly into the predicted landing coordinates.",
    "Across elite athletics (ice hockey, baseball, tennis), physical strobe glasses have become standard conditioning gear (Smith & Mitroff, 2016). Strobe Prediction Pursuit brings this elite training regimen into the browser, alternating 60 visible frames with 30 occluded frames. Paired with high refresh rates (144Hz+) to keep occlusion switching frame-accurate (Woods et al., 2015), this drill bridges the gap between sensory perception and predictive motor execution."
