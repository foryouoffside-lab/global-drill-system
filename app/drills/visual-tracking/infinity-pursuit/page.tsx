      "Smooth pursuit is not a single muscle action; it requires continuous, proportional firing across all six extraocular muscles to guide the fovea along 2D spatial curves (Robinson, 1965; Leigh & Zee, 2015). While one-dimensional tracking exercises isolated horizontal or vertical muscles, real-world sports and gaming environments require simultaneous multi-axial coordination.",
      "Infinity Pursuit utilizes a Lemniscate of Bernoulli figure-8 trajectory. This continuous curve transitions smoothly between left and right visual hemifields, forcing the brain to modulate pursuit gain across diagonal, vertical, and horizontal vectors while executing seamless directional reversals at the central intersection (Barnes, 2008; Krauzlis, 2004).",
    "Hardware latency adds display quantization (~16.7 ms at 60 Hz, ~6.9 ms at 144 Hz) and input polling intervals (~8 ms at 125 Hz vs ~1 ms at 1,000 Hz), as documented by Woods et al. (2015). All scores remain stored strictly in local browser storage."
