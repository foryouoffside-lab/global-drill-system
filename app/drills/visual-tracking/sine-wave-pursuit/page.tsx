  intro: [
    "The fidelity of the human oculomotor smooth pursuit system is most rigorously tested when tracking harmonic oscillatory trajectories rather than simple linear paths. Along a sinusoidal curve, target velocity and acceleration fluctuate continuously: speed reaches its maximum at the central zero-crossing axis, while decelerating smoothly to zero at the orbital crests and troughs before reversing direction (Stark et al., 1962; Robinson, 1965).",
    "Neurological investigations by David Robinson (1965) and Barnes (2008) established that while unpredictable motion produces a mandatory 130 to 150 ms sensorimotor delay (phase lag), periodic sinusoidal stimulation triggers rapid cerebellar adaptation. By establishing a predictive internal rhythm, feedforward motor commands fire directly to extraocular motor nuclei, achieving zero phase lag synchronization.",
    "When tracking frequency or velocity exceeds physiological limits, pursuit gain collapses. As demonstrated by Rashbass (1961) and Bahill et al. (1980), when eye velocity lags target speed, the visual system resorts to stuttered catch-up saccades. Sine Wave Pursuit conditions the extraocular neuromuscular apparatus to sustain seamless unity gain (1.0) without saccadic disruptions."
