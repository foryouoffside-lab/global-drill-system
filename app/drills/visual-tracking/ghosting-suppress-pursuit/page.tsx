      "When objects move across the visual field, physical display latency and biological retinal persistence can generate trailing ghost artifacts and perceptual motion smear (Burr, 1980). Without robust attentional filtering, trailing visual noise draws foveal gaze backward, disrupting smooth pursuit gain and causing targeting errors.",
      "Ghosting Suppress Pursuit conditions foveal fixation stability. By projecting simulated ghosting rings behind a moving target, this drill exercises cortical distractor suppression circuits, training the visual system to lock gaze onto true target coordinates and ignore peripheral artifact clutter (Martinez-Conde et al., 2004; Rolfs, 2009; Leigh & Zee, 2015).",
    "Hardware latency adds display quantization (~16.7 ms at 60 Hz, ~6.9 ms at 144 Hz) and input polling intervals (~8 ms at 125 Hz vs ~1 ms at 1,000 Hz), as documented by Woods et al. (2015). All scores remain stored strictly in local browser storage."
