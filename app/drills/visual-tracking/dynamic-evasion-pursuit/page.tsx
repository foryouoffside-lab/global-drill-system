    "Dynamic Evasion Pursuit is a free browser drill where a target moves in straight lines and then cuts away in a new direction without warning. You follow it with your eyes and re-find it after each cut. Choose a speed and duration, press start, and keep the target in view.",
    
    
      "Predictable pursuit pathways enable the brain to use feedforward anticipatory motor commands, tracking targets with very little lag (Bahill et al., 1980). However, real-world competitive encounters—such as an opposing player executing an evasive strafe or a ball deflecting off an opponent—feature abrupt trajectory disruptions where feedforward models fail.",
      "Dynamic Evasion Pursuit isolates reactive gaze re-acquisition. Targets move along straight paths before executing sharp, unannounced directional cuts. When the target cuts, smooth pursuit velocity matching fails instantly, producing retinal position error that triggers a rapid catch-up saccade to re-center the fovea (Rashbass, 1961; Krauzlis, 2004; Barnes, 2008).",
    "Hardware latency adds display quantization (~16.7 ms at 60 Hz, ~6.9 ms at 144 Hz) and input polling intervals (~8 ms at 125 Hz vs ~1 ms at 1,000 Hz), as documented by Woods et al. (2015). All scores remain stored strictly in local browser storage."
