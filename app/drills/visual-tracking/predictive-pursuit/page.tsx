  intro: [
    "The human visual system faces a fundamental physiological barrier: sensorimotor processing latency requires approximately 130 to 150 milliseconds for retinal photoreceptor activations to navigate cortical pathways and trigger extraocular muscle contractions. Were visual tracking governed purely by closed-loop feedback, the fovea would suffer constant retinal slip, perpetually lagging behind moving targets. The evolutionary solution to this latency trap is predictive smooth pursuit.",
    "Pioneering research by David Robinson (1965) and Barnes (2008) established that the cerebellum, operating in tight synchrony with frontal eye fields (FEF), extracts velocity and directional vectors during the initial 100 to 200 ms of target flight. Based on these vectors, the brain constructs an internal forward model whose feedforward motor pulses drive extraocular muscles at the exact anticipated target speed, completely eliminating biological transit delay.",
    "In competitive sports and esports, targets frequently suffer visual occlusion behind physical obstacles, terrain, or smokescreens. Research by Bennett & Barnes (2003) demonstrated that frontal working memory stores velocity vectors and sustains oculomotor pursuit autonomously for up to two seconds during total sensory dropout. Predictive Pursuit isolates and conditions this vital feedforward capacity."
