      "A visual memory test flashes a pattern of lit cells on a grid, then asks you to tap the same cells from memory. In this free online version the grid grows from 4x4 to 5x5 as you succeed, and a miss replays the round, so it measures how large a spatial pattern you can hold.",
      "The clinical study of visuospatial span was pioneered by Pietro Corsi (1972) through the Corsi Block-Tapping Test, which demonstrated that visuospatial memory operates as a distinct neural system from verbal digit span (Milner, 1971). In 1997, Sergio Della Sala, Robert H. Logie, and colleagues developed the Visual Patterns Test (VPT) to specifically isolate static matrix pattern retention from dynamic sequential movement.",
      "In modern cognitive neuroscience, Robert H. Logie (1995) and Alan Baddeley (2000) subdivided the Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad into the 'Visual Cache' (a passive store for chromatic, brightness, and static matrix representations) and the 'Inner Scribe' (an active mechanism for spatial movement planning and rehearsal). Furthermore, research by Steven J. Luck & Edward K. Vogel (1997) and Nelson Cowan (2001) confirmed that unchunked visual working memory is strictly bounded to 3 to 4 independent items. Expanding matrix span requires spatial chunking—grouping lit cells into holistic Gestalt shapes.",
      "Calibrated with digital chronometric precision (Woods et al., 2015), this drill features a standardized 1.5-second memorization window and an adaptive staircase progression to measure your exact visuospatial pattern span under high-velocity conditions.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes each change to its refresh interval, about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup.",
      "Data transparency: SkillDrills collects no aggregate data. Your scores and settings live only in your browser's localStorage and are never uploaded, so this site publishes no user averages, percentiles or player counts. Every figure quoted here comes from the published work in the References panel below.",
      "This drill is a free browser game for practice and interest. It is not a medical device, a diagnostic instrument, or a screening or treatment tool for any condition, and no score here says anything about your health or your memory in a clinical sense. If you have concerns about your memory or thinking, speak to a qualified clinician."
