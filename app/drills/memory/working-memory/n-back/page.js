            q: "What is the difference between single N-Back and Dual N-Back?",
            a: "Single N-Back presents one stimulus stream (e.g., visual letters). Dual N-Back presents two independent sensory streams simultaneously (typically visual grid positions and auditory spoken consonants), requiring divided executive updating across both modalities."
          },
          {
            q: "How does sub-vocal articulatory rehearsal assist in N-Back performance?",
            a: "Sub-vocalization recruits the phonological loop (Baddeley, 1986). By mentally chanting the active N-item sequence like an internal sliding queue (e.g., 'C-K-M' becoming 'K-M-R'), you maintain active trace activation against rapid decay."
          },
          {
            q: "Why does performance decline significantly at 4-Back and 5-Back?",
            a: "According to Nelson Cowan's (2001) working memory model, human focal attention has a capacity ceiling of 4 ± 1 unchunked units. At 4-back and 5-back, items exceed this fundamental processing boundary, resulting in interference and intrusion errors."

          {
            q: "How does working memory updating transfer to real-world tasks?",
            a: "Working memory updating supports complex real-time decision making, tracking multiple shifting variables in financial analysis, reading comprehension, software debugging, and tactical adaptability in competitive sports and gaming."
