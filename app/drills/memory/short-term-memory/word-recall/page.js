      "Verbal Memory Test (Word Recall) is a clinical-grade cognitive exercise engineered to assess and strengthen verbal working memory, semantic associative encoding, and immediate free recall capacity. Free recall testing represents one of the most demanding benchmarks of human cognitive architecture, requiring the brain to retrieve information without external prompts or multiple-choice cues.",
      "The scientific study of verbal memory began with Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885), who mathematically formulated the human forgetting curve and the dynamics of serial learning. In 1958, Swiss psychologist André Rey introduced the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), which standardized word list learning to quantify immediate memory span, proactive and retroactive interference, and delayed retrieval across clinical populations.",
      "In 1962, Bennet B. Murdock Jr. mathematically formalized the Serial Position Effect in free recall, demonstrating the distinct operations of the Primacy Effect (long-term consolidation of initial items) and the Recency Effect (temporary maintenance of terminal items in the sensory echoic buffer). Later, Fergus I. M. Craik & Robert S. Lockhart (1972) established the 'Levels of Processing' framework, proving that deep semantic encoding—such as narrative linking and thematic clustering—vastly outperforms shallow rote rehearsal.",
      "Featuring high-precision digital chronometry (Woods et al., 2015), this drill measures both word span and retrieval throughput, converging on your true verbal memory capacity through an adaptive staircase protocol.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes each change to its refresh interval, about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup.",
      "Data transparency: SkillDrills collects no aggregate data. Your scores and settings live only in your browser's localStorage and are never uploaded, so this site publishes no user averages, percentiles or player counts. Every figure quoted here comes from the published work in the References panel below.",
      "This drill is a free browser game for practice and interest. It is not a medical device, a diagnostic instrument, or a screening or treatment tool for any condition, and no score here says anything about your health or your memory in a clinical sense. If you have concerns about your memory or thinking, speak to a qualified clinician."
