  intro: [
    "Reaction time is the elapsed interval between sensory stimulus presentation and motor response execution. In competitive esports (Valorant, CS2, League of Legends) and motorsports, response latency measured in milliseconds determines who lands the opening shot, executes defensive flashes, or reacts to sudden track hazards.",
    "This drill trains visual temporal estimation and mental chronometry using high-precision performance.now() browser timestamps. By memorizing target intervals and triggering your click at the exact elapsed moment, you calibrate your internal neural clock and condition motor response consistency.",
    "Timing Methodology: All measurements are captured client-side using the high-resolution performance.now() API. Hardware latency adds display quantization delay (~16.7 ms at 60 Hz, ~6.9 ms at 144 Hz, ~4.1 ms at 240 Hz) and USB polling intervals (~8 ms at 125 Hz vs ~1 ms at 1000 Hz), as documented by Woods et al. (2015). For the lowest measurement overhead, use a high-refresh display and high-polling gaming mouse.",
    "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
