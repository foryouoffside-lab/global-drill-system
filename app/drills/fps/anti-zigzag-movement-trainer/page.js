    intro: [
      "An anti-zigzag aim trainer teaches you to keep your crosshair on an opponent who zigzags in a V pattern instead of a straight line. This drill sends a target on erratic multi-direction paths while you hold aim, then scores continuous time on target. It suits tracking in Apex, Warzone and Overwatch 2.",
      "In competitive first-person shooters characterized by dynamic movement mechanics—such as Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Overwatch 2—opponents leverage erratic multi-directional zigzagging, slide-canceling, and crouch-spams to break crosshair lock and induce visual-motor desynchronization. While linear smooth pursuit tracking relies on anticipating a continuous trajectory (Krauzlis, 2004), zigzag tracking forces the motor system into a continuous steering task governed by dynamic speed-accuracy constraints (Fitts, 1954; Accot & Zhai, 1997). Action video game players exhibit enhanced visual attention, spatial resolution, and temporal tracking bandwidth (Green & Bavelier, 2003), yet when targets execute sudden oblique vector reversals, the visual system experiences acute retinal slip (Rashbass, 1961), demanding sub-second deceleration and multi-axis wrist re-orientation.",
      "The core mechanical error committed by novice trackers during evasive movement is over-flicking behind the target's outer sweep apex. When an enemy zigzags in a V-pattern, their velocity momentarily drops to zero at the reversal apex before accelerating back through the central corridor. Attempting to chase the outer extremes causes severe overshoot and antagonist muscle fighting. Elite aimers utilize center-line 'V-crossover' anchoring, keeping visual focus anchored on the central axis and executing smooth velocity-matched micro-adjustments as the opponent crosses back through the reticle.",
      "Anti-Zigzag Aim Trainer runs directly in modern web browsers via the HTML5 Pointer Lock API with performance.now() chronometry. It does not request unadjusted input, so turn off OS pointer acceleration for consistent movement. Browser timers are coarsened to about 1 ms for security, so treat sub-5 ms differences as noise. By testing continuous dwell-time damage mechanics against scaling zigzag frequency, this drill trains the sensorimotor suppression required to eliminate panic flicks and conquer evasive gunfights.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
