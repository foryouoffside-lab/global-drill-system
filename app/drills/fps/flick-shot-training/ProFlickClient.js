  "Pro Flick Trainer isolates macro flicking and stopping deceleration, the two mechanical skills that decide most off-angle duels in tactical FPS games like CS2, Valorant, and Apex Legends. Enemies rarely appear where your crosshair already rests. Winning those engagements requires snapping your crosshair from a neutral position to an arbitrary target coordinate in a single, fluid motor movement, then killing the momentum before you overshoot.",
  "Each round spawns a single target at a random point inside your field of view — no pattern to memorize, no predictable rhythm, every flick starts cold, exactly like a real peek. Target radius and time-to-live both shrink as your score climbs, so the drill keeps pace with you instead of staying static once you've adapted to it."

const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  { q: "What is flick aim?", a: "Flick aim is the mechanical ability to quickly snap your crosshair to a target outside of your immediate focus area using a single, swift mouse movement." },
  { q: "How do I improve flick aim?", a: "Improve flick aim by practicing raw input drills that penalize misses and reward speed, forcing you to map the physical mousepad space to your monitor accurately." },
  { q: "What is a good flick accuracy?", a: "A good baseline flick accuracy is around 70%. Advanced players aim for 80%+, while professional esports players maintain 90%+ precision during high-speed target acquisition." },
  { q: "Does flick training help Valorant?", a: "Yes, Valorant heavily relies on crosshair placement and first-shot accuracy. Flick training improves your ability to react and snap to off-angle enemies instantly." },
  { q: "Does flick training help CS2?", a: "Absolutely. Counter-Strike requires immense micro and macro flicking, especially with AWPing or reacting to unexpected peekers." },
  { q: "Can flick aim be learned?", a: "Yes, flick aim is a physical motor skill. Through repetitive practice with zero hardware acceleration, you develop muscle memory that makes flicking subconscious." },
  { q: "How long should I practice?", a: "Aim for 15-20 minutes of dedicated flick aim training daily before playing competitive matches to optimize muscle memory retention without causing fatigue." },
  { q: "Should I use arm aim?", a: "For macro-flicks (large distances across the screen), arm aiming is generally preferred as it provides better stability and consistency on low sensitivities." },
  { q: "Should I use wrist aim?", a: "Wrist and fingertip aiming should be used for micro-flicks and fine adjustments once your arm brings the crosshair near the target." },
  { q: "How important is sensitivity?", a: "Sensitivity is crucial. You must find a consistent sensitivity (eDPI) and stick to it so your brain can properly map physical hand movement to virtual crosshair movement." },
  { q: "Can aim trainers improve rank?", a: "Yes, aim trainers isolate mechanical flaws. By improving your raw mechanical skill, you win more aim duels, which naturally translates to ranking up." },
  { q: "What is target acquisition?", a: "Target acquisition is the combined cognitive and physical process of visually locating an enemy and moving your crosshair onto them." },
  { q: "What is snap aiming?", a: "Snap aiming is another term for flicking. It emphasizes the fast, abrupt 'snapping' motion of the crosshair onto a target." },
  { q: "Why do I overshoot targets?", a: "Overshooting usually means your sensitivity is too high, or you haven't built enough stopping power (deceleration control) in your wrist." },
  { q: "How do pro players train aim?", a: "Pros use a combination of dedicated aim trainers (like this one), in-game deathmatches, and routine warmup regimens to maintain peak mechanical precision." },
  { q: "How does the scoring system work?", a: "Hits grant base points multiplied by your combo multiplier and level multiplier. Misses and timeouts reset your combo multiplier." },
  { q: "Does the drill get harder while I'm on a streak?", a: "Yes. Beyond the 15-level curve, a live streak 'heat' system shrinks targets and speeds up spawns the longer your hit streak runs, capping out at the same 50-combo streak that maxes your score multiplier. A miss cools the heat back to your level's baseline, so a hot run never gets easier to sustain." }
