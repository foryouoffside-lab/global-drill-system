      "A flick aim trainer is a practice tool for snapping your crosshair onto a target with one fast mouse movement and clicking. In this drill targets appear at new positions, you flick to each one and the speed and accuracy of every shot is recorded. It helps build the flick shots used in Valorant, CS2 and Apex Legends.",
      "Flick aim (snap targeting) is the biomechanical process of translating an ocular fixation into an explosive ballistic limb-and-wrist trajectory. In psychomotor science, human goal-directed aiming is governed by the two-component model (Elliott et al., 2010): an initial open-loop ballistic impulse that covers the bulk of the distance, followed by a closed-loop visual feedback phase that executes minute terminal homing corrections.",
      "Under Fitts's Law (Fitts, 1954), movement duration scales predictably with task difficulty: ID = log2(2D/W), where target distance (D) and target diameter (W) dictate movement time. Precision training optimizes agonist-antagonist muscular deceleration (Schmidt et al., 1979), enabling players to stop their mouse abruptly on target without overshooting.",
      "Hardware latency and digital chronometry significantly influence measurable flick performance. Browser chronometry in this trainer is driven by high-resolution performance.now() timestamps. At 1000 Hz mouse polling (1.0 ms USB intervals) and high-refresh displays (144 Hz at 6.94 ms, 240 Hz at 4.17 ms per frame), input quantization jitter is minimized, enabling pure neuromuscular acquisition testing (Woods et al., 2015).",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
