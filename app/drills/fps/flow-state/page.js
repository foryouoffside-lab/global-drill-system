First formalized by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, flow occurs when a player's perceived skills precisely match the challenge level of the game. In competitive FPS titles, flow manifests as fluid crosshair tracking, zero conscious hesitation, suppressed internal monologue, and heightened situational awareness."

Engaging in a 5–10 minute continuous smooth pursuit drill with progressive difficulty before matches establishes neural synchronization and prepares the visual cortex for effortless tracking."

    intro: [
      "A flow state aim trainer is a tracking drill that adjusts its difficulty to your skill so the challenge stays just hard enough to hold your attention. Here you follow a target along continuous curves while speed scales with your performance, building sustained focus and smooth aim in FPS games.",
      "Flow State Trainer is engineered at the intersection of cognitive psychology and motor neuroscience to systematically induce psychological flow, sustained attention endurance, and smooth pursuit precision. Grounded in the seminal flow research of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (1975, 1990), flow represents the optimal state of immersion where perceived challenge dynamically equilibrates with motor capability, eliminating self-doubt, cognitive distraction, and conscious hesitation.",
      "Complementing this, Arne Dietrich's transient hypofrontality hypothesis (2004) explains the underlying neural state: selective downregulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) allows motor execution to be orchestrated effortlessly by the basal ganglia and cerebellum. In competitive first-person shooters, this downregulation frees player reflexes from conscious over-thinking, enabling lightning-fast micro-corrections and unbroken focus under pressure.",
      "Through high-frequency hardware chronometry using performance.now() (Woods et al., 2015) and continuous fluid Bezier curve trajectories (Krauzlis, 2004; Posner & Petersen, 1990), this drill provides an optimal, zero-install canvas for mastering cognitive focus, eliminating target slip, and sustaining elite mental stamina.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
