    intro: [
      "Vertical Aim Trainer (Vertical Air-Track) is an advanced motor-control drill engineered to isolate and cultivate Y-axis tracking precision, gravitational arc prediction, and aerial target interception. In modern movement shooters—such as Apex Legends, Overwatch 2, Halo Infinite, and Destiny 2—opponents frequently exploit verticality via jump pads, grapple hooks, elevation lifts, and high-ground drops to disrupt horizontal crosshair placement.",
      "The neurobiology of vertical pursuit tracking differs fundamentally from horizontal tracking. Richard J. Krauzlis (2004) showed that vertical smooth pursuit engages distinct cerebellar vermis and brainstem pathways, showing higher susceptibility to motor jitter due to the asymmetry of upper-limb musculoskeletal biomechanics. Cyril Rashbass (1961) proved that smooth pursuit is driven by velocity error (retinal slip) rather than positional error, requiring continuous speed matching rather than static flicking.",
      "Tracking airborne entities requires internalizing gravitational physics ($g = 9.81\\text{ m/s}^2$). As established by Peter R. Cavanagh et al. (1984) and Michael F. Land & Peter McLeod (2000), human visual motor systems anticipate parabolic trajectory deceleration at the jump apex and rapid acceleration during descent. Players who fail to anticipate this velocity curvature consistently under-track falling targets.",
      "By eliminating horizontal crutches and isolating pure Y-axis motion with performance.now() digital chronometry (Woods et al., 2015), this drill bridges the gap between horizontal muscle memory and 360-degree three-dimensional tracking proficiency.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
