    intro: [
      "180° snap targeting is a multimodal sensorimotor task requiring seamless coordination between peripheral visual detection, ocular foveation, and ballistic limb biomechanics. In human neurobiology, peripheral retinal rods detect high-velocity luminance and motion changes across visual angles exceeding 90° from the central line of sight, triggering rapid orienting saccades via the superior colliculus (Rayner, 1998; Leigh & Zee, 2015).",
      "Translating peripheral detection into a 180° virtual reorientation requires a two-component motor impulse (Elliott et al., 2010). An open-loop ballistic forearm swipe propelled by the shoulder and elbow covers 80% to 90% of the required rotational arc, followed immediately by antagonistic muscular braking to eliminate crosshair overshoot (Schmidt et al., 1979). Under Fitts's Law (Fitts, 1954), large angular amplitudes inherently increase task Index of Difficulty (ID = log2(2D/W)), making stopping power and physical mousepad calibration paramount.",
      "Digital chronometry in this trainer is executed via performance.now() timestamps under the HTML5 Pointer Lock API. Browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation -- typically to about 1 ms -- so treat differences under roughly 5 ms as noise. Operating with 1000 Hz mouse polling (1.0 ms USB intervals) and high-refresh display synchronization eliminates cursor acceleration distortion and reduces input quantization jitter, providing an objective benchmark of spatial reaction mechanics (Woods et al., 2015).",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
