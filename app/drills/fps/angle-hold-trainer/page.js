    intro: [
      "An angle hold trainer lets you practice the defensive skill of standing still with your crosshair pre-aimed at a corner and clicking the moment an enemy crosses it. Angle Hold Pro measures your reaction time and trigger discipline, so you can build crosshair placement habits for CS2, Valorant and other tactical shooters.",
      "Defensive angle holding is a foundational tactical shooter discipline governed by Donders' simple reaction time (Donders, 1868) and visual Go/No-Go cognitive discrimination. Unlike flick targeting which requires a dynamic two-component motor impulse (Woodworth, 1899; Meyer et al., 1988), holding an angle pre-aligns the crosshair along the horizontal head plane, transforming the challenge from a 2D spatial search into a 1D temporal click-timing execution.",
      "In online multiplayer netcode architectures (such as Valve's CS2 sub-tick system and Riot Games' Valorant infrastructure), network packet transit produces an asymmetrical latency delay known as peeker's advantage: T_advantage = (RTT_peeker / 2) + (RTT_holder / 2) + T_interp. An attacker swinging a corner sees the defender before the defender's client receives the update. To systematically neutralize this deficit, stationary defenders must offset their crosshair away from the corner wall by D_offset = v_peeker × T_reaction, allowing the swinging opponent to enter the crosshair focal point precisely as the human click fires.",
      "Motor precision adheres to Fitts's Law (Fitts, 1954) and impulse variability principles: micro-flicks introduced while holding introduce motor noise. High-resolution digital chronometry in Angle Hold Pro is powered by performance.now() timestamps under 1000 Hz mouse polling and display refresh synchronization. This minimizes input quantization jitter (Woods et al., 2015), providing a useful relative measure of trigger discipline, reaction latency, and bait-peek discrimination under time pressure (Hick, 1952).",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
