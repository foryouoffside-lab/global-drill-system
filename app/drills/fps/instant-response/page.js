It encompasses sensory transduction in the retina, signal transmission along the optic nerve, cortical processing in the visual and motor cortices, corticospinal conduction, and finger switch actuation. In this drill, it is measured with performance.now() timing using the browser's performance.now() high-resolution timestamp API."

While innate nerve conduction velocity is largely fixed biologically, deliberate reaction training reduces cortical processing delays by strengthening synaptic pathways between visual motion areas (MT/V5) and the pre-motor cortex. Training also develops optimal pre-motor muscle priming and eliminates hesitation, shaving 20 to 40 milliseconds off raw stimulus response latency."

Choice Reaction Time (Type B) requires discriminating between multiple stimuli and selecting the corresponding motor response, which introduces cognitive decision latency governed by Hick\'s Law."

      "FPS Reaction Time Test is an empirical mental chronometry drill designed to measure, benchmark, and sharpen sensory-motor reflex latency for competitive first-person shooters. In high-stakes tactical shooters like Valorant and Counter-Strike 2, gunfight outcomes are decided within fractions of a second when an opponent swings across an held angle.",
      "The scientific foundation of mental chronometry was first formalized by Dutch ophthalmologist Franciscus Cornelis Donders (1868), whose pioneering subtraction method isolated Simple Reaction Time (Type A: unprimed detection to motor discharge) from complex Choice Reaction Time (Type B: cognitive stimulus discrimination and response selection, later formalized mathematically in Hick\'s Law, 1952). While choice tasks require variable cognitive arbitration, simple visual reaction time represents the raw neurological throughput of the human central nervous system.",
      "Timed with performance.now() hardware timestamping (Woods et al., 2015) and HTML5 Pointer Lock coordinate tracking, this drill isolates raw sensory detection from cursor travel time. By introducing randomized exposure intervals, variable flash durations, and feint penalty mechanics, it trains players to eliminate anticipation pre-firing and execute fast-twitch trigger pulls with ruthless consistency.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
