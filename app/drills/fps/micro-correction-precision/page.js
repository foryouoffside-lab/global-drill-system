    intro: [
      "Micro-Correction Aim Trainer is an empirical sensorimotor training drill engineered to isolate, calibrate, and master the secondary adjustment phase of visual targeting. In high-stakes competitive shooters such as Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, and Rainbow Six Siege, combat encounters are frequently won or lost by sub-degree corrections of only 5 to 25 pixels.",
      "The theoretical framework governing rapid targeted movement was established by Robert S. Woodworth (1899) in his seminal two-component model: an initial open-loop ballistic impulse propelling the limb toward the visual stimulus, followed by a closed-loop current control phase governed by continuous sensory feedback. This speed-accuracy trade-off was mathematically codified by Paul M. Fitts (1954) in Fitts' Law, where movement time scales logarithmically with target distance and inversely with target width (Index of Difficulty = log2(2D / W)).",
      "Later neuro-computational refinements by David E. Meyer et al. (1988) introduced the Stochastic Optimized Submovement Model, demonstrating that human motor control plans primary movements to fall slightly short of or near the target boundary, relying on rapid corrective submovements to resolve coordinate discrepancy without excessive kinetic overrun.",
      "During the high-acuity terminal fixation phase, human ocular dynamics deploy microsaccades—involuntary, rapid foveal shifts of less than 1 degree—to refresh neural representations and center the retina over high-frequency visual targets (Rolfs, 2009; Martinez-Conde et al., 2004). This drill pairs raw pointer lock hardware input with performance.now() digital chronometry (Woods et al., 2015) to help players eliminate terminal oscillation, conquer overflick drift, and land pinpoint headshots with robotic consistency.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
