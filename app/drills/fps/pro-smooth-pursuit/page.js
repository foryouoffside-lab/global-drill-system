    intro: [
      "Smooth Pursuit Aim Trainer is an empirical sensorimotor training drill engineered to cultivate continuous ocular target tracking, harmonic Lissajous curve reading, and jitter-free forearm motor stabilization. In high-TTK competitive shooters such as Apex Legends, Overwatch 2, and The Finals, combat outcomes are governed by damage uptime—demanding that players maintain sustained reticle connection throughout multi-second aerial and ground mobility maneuvers.",
      "The neurological basis of ocular pursuit was mapped by Richard J. Krauzlis (2004), demonstrating that smooth pursuit eye movements are regulated through recurrent cortical loops between the medial superior temporal area (MST), the frontal eye field (FEF), and the primary visual motion cortex (MT/V5). Rather than reacting passively, this neural circuit models target velocity vectors to continuously drive the oculomotor plant in real time.",
      "In a landmark series of psychophysical experiments, Cyril Rashbass (1961) proved that smooth pursuit and saccadic movements are anatomically and functionally dissociated: saccades respond to retinal position displacement, whereas smooth pursuit responds exclusively to retinal image velocity (slip). When players tense their hands or try to 'micro-flick' across a moving target, they disrupt smooth pursuit circuitry, triggering involuntary catch-up saccades that cause noticeable aim stutter.",
      "By combining harmonic Lissajous coordinate generation with foveal gaze leading principles (Land & McLeod, 2000), dynamic attentional tracking expansion (Green & Bavelier, 2003), and high-resolution digital chronometry (Woods et al., 2015), this drill teaches players to eliminate forearm tension, glide through complex non-linear curves, and sustain laser-like beam tracking under competitive pressure.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
