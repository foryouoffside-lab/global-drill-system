    intro: [
      "In fast-paced close-quarters gunfights, duels are frequently decided in fractional seconds where opponents execute erratic ADAD strafes, crouch-spams, and instantaneous velocity reversals. Unlike predictable smooth pursuit tracking where an observer smoothly matches an object traveling along a continuous vector (Krauzlis, 2004), reactive tracking requires continuous closed-loop retinal error detection and rapid motor reversals (Rashbass, 1961). Action video game players demonstrate superior visual attention, contrast sensitivity, and temporal tracking bandwidth (Green & Bavelier, 2003), yet human neurophysiology imposes inescapable sensorimotor processing delays whenever an opponent changes direction.",
      "When an in-game target abruptly changes direction, the human visual system experiences retinal slip: the target image leaves the fovea, traveling across the retina. The brain cannot predict the reversal; it must detect target deceleration, initiate a cortical direction-swap command, decelerate the moving hand, and execute a corrective motor burst. In competitive shooters with high time-to-kill (TTK)—such as Apex Legends, Overwatch 2, and Call of Duty: Warzone—duels are determined by continuous crosshair uptime on moving hitboxes rather than single-frame click timing.",
      "Anti-Strafe Jitter Trainer operates on the HTML5 Pointer Lock API with raw 1:1 hardware translation, high-resolution performance.now() chronometry, and zero mouse acceleration. By eliminating USB polling jitter and browser interpolation delays (Woods et al., 2015), this trainer provides real-time tracking accuracy and direction-swap reaction chronometry to condition smooth antagonist muscle control and eliminate over-flicking on erratic strafes.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
