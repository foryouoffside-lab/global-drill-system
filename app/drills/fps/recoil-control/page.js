    intro: [
      "A recoil control trainer is a practice tool for learning to pull your mouse against a weapon's spray pattern. In this drill you hold fire at moving targets, pull down against the vertical climb and steer against horizontal sway, then review magazine accuracy and headshots. It suits CS2, Valorant and Apex Legends spray practice.",
      "Recoil Control Trainer is an empirical sensorimotor drill engineered to build the muscle memory required to counteract programmatic weapon spray patterns, vertical climb velocity, and horizontal sway in first-person shooters. In tactical and battle royale shooters such as Counter-Strike 2, VALORANT, Apex Legends, and PUBG, combat frequently extends beyond single-tap headshots. When targets execute erratic evasive maneuvers, sustained automatic fire with tight bullet grouping decides the gunfight.",
      "The motor learning framework governing rapid recoil compensation is defined by Richard A. Schmidt and Timothy D. Lee's Generalized Motor Program (GMP) theory (Schmidt & Lee, 2011). Because 10-round bursts occur in under 700 milliseconds—faster than human closed-loop visual feedback can process individual bullet impacts—elite players execute a pre-structured open-loop motor program containing invariant relative timing and force parameters.",
      "This motor process aligns with Robert S. Woodworth's classic two-component model of aiming (Woodworth, 1899) and David E. Meyer's optimized submovement model (Meyer et al., 1988): an initial ballistic open-loop pull-down of the mouse followed by fine corrective submovements to compensate for horizontal sway and dynamic target strafes.",
      "Motor precision adheres to Fitts's Law (Fitts, 1954) and Schmidt's impulse variability model (Schmidt et al., 1979): as the velocity and force of downward mouse pulling increase, muscular output variability expands. By training with high-resolution digital chronometry using performance.now() (Woods et al., 2015), this drill isolates the steady pull-down velocity necessary to minimize grouping spread.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
