    intro: [
      "Target Prioritization Aim Trainer is an advanced perceptual-cognitive drill engineered to cultivate instantaneous threat assessment, visual distractor suppression, and executive motor inhibition. In tactical shooters—including Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, Rainbow Six Siege, and Apex Legends—clutch survival depends not merely on mechanical flick accuracy, but on target selection: deciding which enemy must be eliminated first while actively suppressing the urge to fire on low-priority distractors or friendly teammates.",
      "The neurological foundation of motor inhibition and decision control was established by Logan and Cowan (1984) through the stop-signal paradigm. They demonstrated that human response execution and response inhibition operate as an interactive 'horse race' between a go-process and a stop-process in the fronto-basal-ganglia network. In chaotic firefights, players who lack inhibitory training suffer from panic firing, discharging their weapon before verifying target alignment.",
      "Visual filtering mechanics were formalized by Donald E. Broadbent (1958) and Anne Treisman (1964) in early filter and attenuation models of selective attention. When multiple visual stimuli compete for processing resources, the brain must deploy top-down attentional gating (Posner & Petersen, 1990) to suppress non-threatening movement while channeling focal attention toward the most imminent threat vector.",
      "By integrating Franciscus Cornelis Donders's (1868) Go/No-Go discrimination models with performance.now() digital chronometry (Woods et al., 2015), this drill bridges the gap between raw mechanical pointing and real-time tactical decision speed under competitive pressure.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
