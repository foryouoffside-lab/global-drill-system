    intro: [
      "Target Acquisition Aim Trainer is a specialized perceptual-cognitive drill engineered to cultivate split-second visual detection, feature contrast discrimination, and lethal first-shot accuracy. In tactical shooters such as Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, and Rainbow Six Siege, round outcomes hinge on the first 300 milliseconds of sightline exposure: the combatant who spots, identifies, and snaps to the opponent's critical silhouette first wins the engagement.",
      "The theoretical foundation of visual search and object identification was formulated by Anne Treisman & Garry Gelade (1980) in Feature-Integration Theory. Treisman demonstrated that low-level visual features—such as luminance contrast, color pop-out, and edge orientation—are extracted preattentively and simultaneously across the entire visual field. Only when focused spatial attention is directed to a specific coordinate are these features bound into a recognizable enemy threat.",
      "Expanding on parallel visual processing, Jeremy M. Wolfe's (1994, 2007) Guided Search model details how top-down cognitive expectations combine with bottom-up sensory salience maps to prioritize attention. When players train visual contrast discrimination, their visual cortex learns to reject low-contrast background clutter and distractors instantly, shortening the latency between target appearance and motor initiation.",
      "By integrating Paul M. Fitts's (1954) motor difficulty laws, David E. Meyer et al.'s (1988) stochastic optimized submovement theory, and high-precision digital chronometry (Woods et al., 2015), this drill trains players to eliminate cognitive hesitation, execute sharp primary flicks, and anchor first-shot precision under competitive pressure.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
