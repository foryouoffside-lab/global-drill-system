    intro: [
      "Target Switching Swarm is a high-velocity motor control and visual indexing drill engineered to condition rapid, unhesitating transitions between multiple hostile targets. In tactical shooters like Counter-Strike 2 and Valorant, and dynamic battle royales like Apex Legends, team fights rarely present isolated 1v1 duels. Winning clutch rounds requires eliminating a primary opponent and instantaneously snapping to neutralize a secondary flanker without post-kill cognitive pause.",
      "The psychophysics of target switching is governed by Fitts' Law (Fitts, 1954) and the stochastic optimized submovement model established by David E. Meyer et al. (1988). Under this framework, an aimed movement comprises an initial ballistic primary submovement covering approximately 90% of the trajectory, followed by feedback-guided micro-corrective secondary submovements. Novice aimers waste 100-250 ms pausing after each kill to confirm the elimination before re-engaging visual search. Elite target switchers initiate the primary saccade to the next target before the previous target's destruction animation even completes.",
      "Visual indexing in crowded target swarms relies on feature integration and preattentive visual search mechanisms (Anne M. Treisman & Garry Gelade, 1980; Jeremy M. Wolfe, 2007). The human visual cortex can track multiple spatial tokens concurrently via visual indexing (FINST theory), allowing players to route efficient spatial flick sequences through clusters of targets, minimizing cumulative angular distance traveled.",
      "How this is measured: every event is timestamped with the browser's performance.now() high-resolution clock, entirely on your device -- no score is uploaded. Two things this cannot control: browser timers are deliberately coarsened as a Spectre mitigation (typically to about 1 ms), and your display quantizes the stimulus to its refresh interval -- about 16.7 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz versus 1 ms at 1000 Hz. So treat differences smaller than about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else's setup."
