    title: 'The Biomechanics of Ballistic Micro-Flicks and Submovement Optimization',
    paragraphs: [
      'In competitive marksmanship and human-computer interaction, a flick shot is a high-velocity, discrete manual aiming movement executed under extreme time constraints. Robert S. Woodworth (1899) first established that goal-directed movements operate via a dual-phase control architecture: an initial ballistic impulse that propels the limb toward the target, followed by a current control phase where visual feedback guides terminal adjustments.',
      'In their seminal theoretical framework, David E. Meyer et al. (1988) formulated the Stochastic Optimized Submovement Model. They proved that human motor output is subject to neural noise proportional to movement velocity. When players flick too fast, primary movement endpoint scatter increases. If the primary impulse lands outside the target boundaries, a costly secondary corrective submovement (~150–200 ms latency) must be triggered.',
      'To achieve elite flicking throughput (MacKenzie, 1992), aimers must calibrate their ballistic impulse velocity so that the primary movement distribution falls reliably within target confines. By rewarding inner bulls-eye center hits, this drill trains the sensorimotor system to tighten endpoint distribution dispersion and minimize corrective deceleration submovements.',
      'The distance-versus-size trade-off behind a flick is Fitts\'s Law: movement time grows with the log of the distance to a target divided by its width (Fitts, 1954). The modern synthesis of the two-phase account — one ballistic impulse followed by visually guided correction, and the many processes that feed it — is Elliott et al. (2010).',
      'How this is measured, and what it cannot resolve: timing comes from the browser\'s performance.now() clock, which is deliberately coarsened to roughly 1 ms as a Spectre mitigation, and the display quantizes every target to its own refresh interval — about 16.7 ms at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz against about 1 ms at 1000 Hz. Treat any difference under about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same mouse and display rather than against someone else\'s setup. SkillDrills stores every score in your browser and collects no aggregate data, so nothing here is a population norm.',
