// ============================================================
// NOTE (2026-09-06): volume and difficulty figures were removed from this block.
// They were not measured. The Bing Webmaster API returns volume only and has no
// difficulty metric, so every "KD: n%" here was invented; the volumes beside them
// came from raw files that returned 100% populated with zero nulls and zero zeros
// on the same day the motor and visual sweeps returned 100% null. Re-measure
// before acting on any of these terms. Phrases are kept; numbers are not.
// Native research: docs/seo/research/jump-sequence-2026-09-20.md
// Primary intent: jump timing drill, jump sequence game, and plyometric rhythm drill.
// This page targets the browser interaction honestly; it does not claim to measure
// real-world jump height. Locale pages use native search clusters independently.
// PAA TARGETS:
//   - What is jump sequence training?
//   - How does the stretch-shortening cycle impact jump height and timing?
//   - How do internal forward models assist mid-air trajectory adjustments?
//   - What is optical tau in dynamic aerial target interception?
//   - How does charge-and-launch timing translate to athletic performance?
//   - Does mid-air steering train motor coordination for competitive gaming?
//   - How does difficulty scale across the 15 levels in Jump Sequence?
//   - What is considered an elite score in Jump Sequence?
//   - Why does missing a target reset the combo multiplier?
//   - What equipment is required to perform Jump Sequence training?

      'This drill measures whether you can predict where a falling target will be and place the cursor there in time, rather than reacting to where it currently is.',
      'How this is measured, and what it cannot resolve: timing comes from the browser\'s performance.now() clock, which is deliberately coarsened to roughly 1 ms as a Spectre mitigation, and the display quantizes every event to its own refresh interval — about 16.7 ms at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz against about 1 ms at 1000 Hz. Treat any difference under about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else\'s. SkillDrills stores every score in your browser and collects no aggregate data, so nothing here is a population norm.',
