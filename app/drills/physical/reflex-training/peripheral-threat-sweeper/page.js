      'This drill measures detection of targets away from the centre of gaze, where visual detail falls off sharply but attention can still be shifted without moving the eyes.',
      'Every reach in this drill is also a Fitts\'s Law movement: the time to land on a target grows with the logarithm of the distance to it divided by its width, so a target half the size costs about the same extra time as one twice as far away (Fitts, 1954).',
      'How this is measured, and what it cannot resolve: timing comes from the browser\'s performance.now() clock, which is deliberately coarsened to roughly 1 ms as a Spectre mitigation, and the display quantizes every event to its own refresh interval — about 16.7 ms at 60 Hz, 6.9 ms at 144 Hz and 4.1 ms at 240 Hz (Woods et al., 2015). Mouse polling adds roughly 8 ms at 125 Hz against about 1 ms at 1000 Hz. Treat any difference under about 5 ms as measurement noise, and compare your own runs on the same hardware rather than against someone else\'s. SkillDrills stores every score in your browser and collects no aggregate data, so nothing here is a population norm.',
